<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.19" dur="5.336">On November 22, 1995, Toy Story 
was released in theaters in the US.</text><text start="6.526" dur="5.204">You couldn’t take it home to watch it
on your VCR until October 29th, 1996 --</text><text start="11.73" dur="2.389">11 months after it opened.</text><text start="14.119" dur="2.961">This is called the theatrical window:</text><text start="17.08" dur="2.74">when a movie is shown only in theaters.</text><text start="19.82" dur="2.89">And it’s gotten way smaller over time.</text><text start="22.71" dur="3.467">Toy Story 4 was released in June of 2019.</text><text start="26.177" dur="4.243">To watch it at home, you only had to wait
about 3 months.</text><text start="30.42" dur="3.579">This shrinking window is the result 
of a decades-long fight</text><text start="33.999" dur="3.06">between movie theaters and movie studios.</text><text start="37.059" dur="2.941">But how much smaller
can the window get?</text><text start="40" dur="3.599">Are movie theaters close to becoming 
a thing of the past?</text><text start="45.726" dur="2.658">Thanks to a Supreme Court
case from the 1940s,</text><text start="48.384" dur="4.673">movie studios and theater owners 
in the US are separate entities.</text><text start="53.057" dur="3.988">For a while, the only way to see a movie 
was to go to a theater.</text><text start="57.045" dur="1.322">But pretty soon...</text><text start="58.367" dur="0.923">&amp;quot;Televison--&amp;quot;</text><text start="59.29" dur="0.71">&amp;quot;--VHS--&amp;quot;</text><text start="60" dur="0.878">&amp;quot;--DVD--&amp;quot;</text><text start="62.193" dur="5.079">The days of theaters being the only way 
to watch a movie are long gone.</text><text start="67.272" dur="2.154">To defend against those new competitors,</text><text start="69.426" dur="2.366">theater owners have struck deals
with movie studios</text><text start="71.792" dur="2.208"> to give them a window of exclusivity</text><text start="74" dur="2.93">before a movie could be seen 
in any other format.</text><text start="76.93" dur="2.9">Movie studios agreed because 
it worked for them, too.</text><text start="79.83" dur="2.255">ZORADI: We created these windows because</text><text start="82.085" dur="3.645">they were really good for 
the motion picture business.</text><text start="85.73" dur="2.767">That&amp;#39;s Mark Zoradi, a former Disney executive.</text><text start="88.497" dur="2.922">ZORADI: ...from 1980 until 2010...</text><text start="91.419" dur="1.021">But today, he&amp;#39;s...</text><text start="92.44" dur="2.33">ZORADI: ...the CEO of Cinemark Theaters.</text><text start="94.77" dur="3.467">The third largest theater chain 
in the US and Canada. </text><text start="98.237" dur="3.046">Theater owners generally want 
a longer exclusive window,</text><text start="101.283" dur="3.717">because they only make money 
while a film is in theaters.</text><text start="105" dur="4.892">And even then they’re splitting
ticket profits, roughly 50/50.</text><text start="109.892" dur="2.019">But movie studios have the opportunity</text><text start="111.911" dur="3.822">to keep making money long after a film
is shown in theaters.</text><text start="115.733" dur="5.187">In fact, it’s become essential for studios to
recoup their investments on expensive films.</text><text start="120.92" dur="1.08">ZORADI: In order for you to break even,</text><text start="122" dur="3.211">then you&amp;#39;ve got to go right down the line,
with multiple bites </text><text start="125.211" dur="2.717">in order to make that all back.</text><text start="127.928" dur="3.726">In the beginning, the minimum
theatrical window was quite long.</text><text start="131.654" dur="1.474">But obviously...</text><text start="133.128" dur="1.602">CORCORAN: Over time, that&amp;#39;s shrunk.</text><text start="134.73" dur="1.34">With the introduction of DVDs,</text><text start="136.07" dur="3.03">you had a window at roughly
six months.</text><text start="139.1" dur="3.809">ZORADI: The window, prior to
the pandemic, was essentially</text><text start="142.909" dur="3.983">74 days before a movie would go to 
electronic sell through.</text><text start="146.892" dur="3.861">That means a digital release you can buy,
on a platform like iTunes.</text><text start="150.753" dur="4.059">ZORADI: And then at 90 days they
would take it to DVD, VOD, </text><text start="154.812" dur="4.125">and then after that, they would take it to
pay television or streaming.</text><text start="158.937" dur="2.474">That&amp;#39;s kind of how the sequence is.</text><text start="161.411" dur="3.009">But studios haven’t always 
gotten their way.</text><text start="164.42" dur="4.728">In 2010, Warner Bros.&amp;#39;s parent company 
proposed a window of 30 days.</text><text start="169.148" dur="2.695">Which theater owners didn’t agree to.</text><text start="171.843" dur="2.357">Netflix challenged the window 
a few years later,</text><text start="174.2" dur="3.985">planning a movie release in IMAX
and on Netflix at the same time.</text><text start="178.185" dur="3.064">Major theater chains banned their films.</text><text start="181.249" dur="2.962">One studio has been really persistent though.</text><text start="184.211" dur="3.391">RUBIN: Universal has been probably 
the most public and aggressive </text><text start="187.602" dur="2.476">about wanting to shorten 
the theatrical window.</text><text start="190.078" dur="4.545">In 2011, Universal made plans to
release the film Tower Heist on demand </text><text start="194.623" dur="2.163">30 days after it hit theaters.</text><text start="196.786" dur="3.4">Some chains threatened to 
not show the film at all.</text><text start="200.186" dur="4.96">Universal ultimately backed down,
and kept their window at 90 days.</text><text start="205.798" dur="5.583">Ultimately, theaters need studios, 
because they need movies to show.</text><text start="211.381" dur="3.978">Studios need theaters to make big money
and get big press.</text><text start="215.359" dur="3.113">And that mutual need kept things stable.</text><text start="218.472" dur="1.262">For a while.</text><text start="219.734" dur="1.001">Until...</text><text start="220.735" dur="1.635">&amp;quot;Theaters shut down due to the global pandemic.&amp;quot;</text><text start="222.37" dur="2.1">&amp;quot;Movie theaters were forced 
to close their doors.&amp;quot;</text><text start="224.47" dur="2.6">&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;ve been trying to survive the coronavirus.&amp;quot;</text><text start="227.07" dur="1.6">(Overlapping) &amp;quot;Bankruptcy.&amp;quot;</text><text start="228.67" dur="2.07">&amp;quot;...in AMC&amp;#39;s future.&amp;quot;</text><text start="231.444" dur="2.923">RUBIN: The power dynamic shifted a lot 
during the pandemic.</text><text start="234.367" dur="3.193">In 2020, studios had newfound leverage</text><text start="237.56" dur="3.04">and one company struck 
while the iron was hot.</text><text start="240.6" dur="2.567">RUBIN: Universal had this movie,
Trolls: World Tour.</text><text start="243.167" dur="1.344">And they had two options.</text><text start="244.511" dur="4.399">One, they could delay it, or two they could
test what they&amp;#39;ve always wanted to do</text><text start="248.91" dur="4.002">and put the movie in theaters and on video
on demand on the same day.</text><text start="252.912" dur="4.479">And the caveat there is that there weren&amp;#39;t
any movie theaters open to play it.</text><text start="257.391" dur="4.989">Trolls: World Tour quickly became 
the highest grossing digital release ever.</text><text start="262.38" dur="3.46">It made more money for Universal 
in 3 weeks at home</text><text start="265.84" dur="3.807">than the original film did 
in its theatrical run.</text><text start="269.647" dur="3.484">NBCUniversal’s head of film 
told the Wall Street Journal:</text><text start="273.131" dur="5.189">“As soon as theaters reopen, we expect 
to release movies on both formats.”</text><text start="278.32" dur="1.022">In other words:</text><text start="279.342" dur="4.004">in theaters and on demand at the same time.</text><text start="283.346" dur="2.267">The two biggest theater chains in the US</text><text start="285.613" dur="4.247">fired back by saying they’d never show 
Universal films again.</text><text start="289.86" dur="2.342">But things were different now.</text><text start="292.202" dur="5.235">The major film studios had restructured
to make streaming their primary focus.</text><text start="297.437" dur="7.193">Warner Bros. released their entire 2021 slate
in theaters and on HBO Max at the same time.</text><text start="304.63" dur="4.76">Disney and Universal made a similar move.</text><text start="309.39" dur="5.274">CORCORAN: With that upset came time
for theater owners and Universal</text><text start="314.664" dur="3.355">and the other studios, frankly, to
start having those conversations</text><text start="318.019" dur="5.069">and working out about what the future looks
like, and what a post-pandemic model is.</text><text start="323.088" dur="4.352">In 2021 the major theater chains
made deals to shorten the window.</text><text start="327.44" dur="6.126">Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. agreed
to a 45 day window in 2022 and onwards.</text><text start="333.566" dur="4.512">But Universal got its own deal 
with the big theater chains.</text><text start="338.078" dur="3.962">They agreed to give theaters a portion of
their video on demand revenue.</text><text start="342.04" dur="4.76">And in return they secured 
one of the shortest windows ever.</text><text start="346.8" dur="4.826">31 days for their biggest movies,
17 days on their smaller movies.</text><text start="352.361" dur="1.709">But one thing that’s noticeably absent</text><text start="354.07" dur="4.319">from all of these deals is any sign of 
a same-day release strategy,</text><text start="358.389" dur="4.813">where a movie comes out on demand 
and in theaters at the same time.</text><text start="363.202" dur="2.668">At what seemed to be
their most powerful moment,</text><text start="365.87" dur="5.529">studios decided to keep the 
theatrical window in place.</text><text start="371.399" dur="4.886">That&amp;#39;s partly because movie theaters are still
pretty big money makers for studios.</text><text start="376.285" dur="5.428">But it&amp;#39;s also because movie theaters can sort
of change how the public sees a movie.</text><text start="381.713" dur="3.867">CORCORAN: Streaming customers value 
theatrical releases more highly.</text><text start="385.58" dur="2.152">It carries with it sort of an aura of quality</text><text start="387.732" dur="1.848">ZORADI: It &amp;quot;eventizes&amp;quot; a movie.</text><text start="389.58" dur="6.79">It&amp;#39;s a shared experience that helps become
almost like a zeitgeist within the culture.</text><text start="396.37" dur="5.226">The pandemic shifted the power dynamic towards
movie studios and away from theaters.</text><text start="401.596" dur="5.084">But it also showed that 
they still need each other.</text><text start="406.68" dur="3.32">That doesn’t necessarily mean 
theaters will be around forever.</text><text start="410" dur="6.581">But if they can survive a pandemic, maybe
they&amp;#39;re stronger than we thought.</text></transcript>

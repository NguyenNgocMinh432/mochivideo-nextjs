<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="6.56" dur="2.121">Way before the first selfie,</text><text start="8.681" dur="2.202">the ancient Greeks and Romans had a myth</text><text start="10.883" dur="3.722">about someone a little too obsessed 
with his own image.</text><text start="14.605" dur="1.29">In one telling,</text><text start="15.895" dur="4.884">Narcissus was a handsome guy wandering
the world in search of someone to love.</text><text start="20.779" dur="2.456">After rejecting a nymph named Echo,</text><text start="23.235" dur="3.474">he caught a glimpse 
of his own reflection in a river,</text><text start="26.709" dur="1.802">and fell in love with it.</text><text start="28.511" dur="1.605">Unable to tear himself away,</text><text start="30.116" dur="1.828">Narcissus drowned.</text><text start="31.944" dur="5.096">A flower marked the spot of where he died,
and we call that flower the Narcissus.</text><text start="37.04" dur="3.351">The myth captures 
the basic idea of narcissism,</text><text start="40.391" dur="3.789">elevated and sometimes 
detrimental self-involvement.</text><text start="44.18" dur="4.094">But it&amp;#39;s not just a personality type
that shows up in advice columns.</text><text start="48.274" dur="4.692">It&amp;#39;s actually a set of traits classified
and studied by psychologists.</text><text start="52.966" dur="5.806">The psychological definition of narcissism
is an inflated, grandiose self-image.</text><text start="58.772" dur="3.347">To varying degrees, narcissists think
they&amp;#39;re better looking,</text><text start="62.119" dur="0.854">smarter,</text><text start="62.973" dur="2.26">and more important than other people,</text><text start="65.233" dur="2.778">and that they deserve special treatment.</text><text start="68.011" dur="4.756">Psychologists recognize two forms
of narcissism as a personality trait:</text><text start="72.767" dur="3.122">grandiose and vulnerable narcissism.</text><text start="75.889" dur="2.517">There&amp;#39;s also narcissistic 
personality disorder,</text><text start="78.406" dur="3.66">a more extreme form,
which we&amp;#39;ll return to shortly.</text><text start="82.066" dur="3.735">Grandiose narcissism 
is the most familiar kind,</text><text start="85.801" dur="1.988">characterized by extroversion,</text><text start="87.789" dur="1.167">dominance,</text><text start="88.956" dur="1.575">and attention seeking.</text><text start="90.531" dur="3.281">Grandiose narcissists pursue 
attention and power,</text><text start="93.812" dur="1.645">sometimes as politicians,</text><text start="95.457" dur="1">celebrities,</text><text start="96.457" dur="1.833">or cultural leaders.</text><text start="98.29" dur="4.346">Of course, not everyone who pursues
these positions of power is narcissistic.</text><text start="102.636" dur="1.77">Many do it for very positive reasons,</text><text start="104.406" dur="1.676">like reaching their full potential,</text><text start="106.082" dur="2.409">or helping make people&amp;#39;s lives better.</text><text start="108.491" dur="2.286">But narcissistic individuals seek power</text><text start="110.777" dur="2.996">for the status 
and attention that goes with it.</text><text start="113.773" dur="4.146">Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissists
can be quiet and reserved.</text><text start="117.919" dur="1.914">They have a strong sense of entitlement,</text><text start="119.833" dur="2.96">but are easily threatened or slighted.</text><text start="122.793" dur="4.268">In either case, the dark side of
narcissism shows up over the long term.</text><text start="127.061" dur="2.93">Narcissists tend to act selfishly,</text><text start="129.991" dur="4.385">so narcissistic leaders may make risky
or unethical decisions,</text><text start="134.376" dur="4.768">and narcissistic partners may be dishonest
or unfaithful.</text><text start="139.144" dur="2.536">When their rosy view of themselves
is challenged,</text><text start="141.68" dur="2.543">they can become resentful and aggressive.</text><text start="144.223" dur="2.961">It&amp;#39;s like a disease where the sufferers
feel pretty good,</text><text start="147.184" dur="2.321">but the people around them suffer.</text><text start="149.505" dur="1.413">Taken to the extreme,</text><text start="150.918" dur="3.29">this behavior is classified 
as a psychological disorder</text><text start="154.208" dur="2.756">called narcissistic personality disorder.</text><text start="156.964" dur="2.963">It affects one to two percent
of the population,</text><text start="159.927" dur="1.579">more commonly men.</text><text start="161.506" dur="3.158">It is also a diagnosis 
reserved for adults.</text><text start="164.664" dur="3.481">Young people, especially children,
can be very self-centered,</text><text start="168.145" dur="3.346">but this might just be a normal
part of development.</text><text start="171.491" dur="3.281">The fifth edition of the American
Psychiatric Association&amp;#39;s</text><text start="174.772" dur="2.539">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</text><text start="177.311" dur="4.547">describes several traits associated
with narcissistic personality disorder.</text><text start="181.858" dur="2.92">They include a grandiose view of oneself,</text><text start="184.778" dur="1.379">problems with empathy,</text><text start="186.157" dur="1.616">a sense of entitlement,</text><text start="187.773" dur="3.031">and a need for admiration or attention.</text><text start="190.804" dur="2.738">What makes these trait a true
personality disorder</text><text start="193.542" dur="4.347">is that they take over people&amp;#39;s lives
and cause significant problems.</text><text start="197.889" dur="3.208">Imagine that instead of caring
for your spouse or children,</text><text start="201.097" dur="3.332">you used them as a source
of attention or admiration.</text><text start="204.429" dur="1.673">Or imagine that instead of seeking</text><text start="206.102" dur="2.306">constructive feedback 
about your performance,</text><text start="208.408" dur="2.389">you instead told everyone 
who tried to help you</text><text start="210.797" dur="2.111">that they were wrong.</text><text start="212.908" dur="2.322">So what causes narcissism?</text><text start="215.23" dur="2.739">Twin studies show 
a strong genetic component,</text><text start="217.969" dur="3.054">although we don&amp;#39;t know 
which genes are involved.</text><text start="221.023" dur="1.872">But environment matters, too.</text><text start="222.895" dur="2.345">Parents who put their child
on a pedestal</text><text start="225.24" dur="2.549">can foster grandiose narcissism.</text><text start="227.789" dur="5.261">And cold, controlling parents
can contribute to vulnerable narcissism.</text><text start="233.05" dur="2.209">Narcissism also seems to be higher</text><text start="235.259" dur="4.17">in cultures that value individuality
and self-promotion.</text><text start="239.429" dur="1.741">In the United States, for example,</text><text start="241.17" dur="4.732">narcissism as a personality trait
has been rising since the 1970s,</text><text start="245.902" dur="2.089">when the communal focus of the 60s</text><text start="247.991" dur="2.159">gave way to the self-esteem movement</text><text start="250.15" dur="2.483">and a rise in materialism.</text><text start="252.633" dur="4.445">More recently, social media has multiplied
the possibilities for self-promotion,</text><text start="257.078" dur="1.293">though it&amp;#39;s worth noting</text><text start="258.371" dur="3.82">that there&amp;#39;s no clear evidence
that social media causes narcissism.</text><text start="262.191" dur="5.573">Rather, it provides narcissists a means
to seek social status and attention.</text><text start="267.764" dur="3.471">So can narcissists improve 
on those negative traits?</text><text start="271.235" dur="1.239">Yes!</text><text start="272.474" dur="2.976">Anything that promotes honest reflection
on their own behavior</text><text start="275.45" dur="1.654">and caring for others,</text><text start="277.104" dur="5.012">like psychotherapy or practicing 
compassion towards others, can be helpful.</text><text start="282.116" dur="2.056">The difficulty is it can be challenging</text><text start="284.172" dur="2.54">for people with 
narcissistic personality disorder</text><text start="286.712" dur="2.199">to keep working at self-betterment.</text><text start="288.911" dur="4.852">For a narcissist, self-reflection is hard
from an unflattering angle.</text></transcript>

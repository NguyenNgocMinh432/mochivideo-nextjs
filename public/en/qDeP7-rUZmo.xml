<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.25" dur="2.61">- This episode is sponsored by Skillshare.</text><text start="2.86" dur="2.22">I saw these images circulating
around the internet that</text><text start="5.08" dur="3.14">showed bacterial cultures
growing in Petri dishes</text><text start="8.22" dur="2.83">and claiming to represent
the effectiveness of masks</text><text start="11.05" dur="2.16">in stopping or minimizing
the spread of germs.</text><text start="13.21" dur="2.79">It was in relation to
COVID-19 and whether or not</text><text start="16" dur="1.4">we should all be wearing masks.</text><text start="17.4" dur="2.38">So today we&amp;#39;re gonna
recreate this experiment and</text><text start="19.78" dur="3.02">document it to see how accurate
it was and whether or not</text><text start="22.8" dur="1.73">our mask results come out the same.</text><text start="24.53" dur="2.65">- Now we trace the images
back to the Twitter user,</text><text start="27.18" dur="3.41">Dr. Rich Davis, love
that very expensive name,</text><text start="30.59" dur="2.89">he is a director of a microbiology lab,</text><text start="33.48" dur="2.05">so yes, his results seem VV legit,</text><text start="35.53" dur="2.9">but we want to reproduce
his demonstration on our own</text><text start="38.43" dur="1.25">for a few reasons.</text><text start="39.68" dur="3.72">One, because it&amp;#39;s an excuse to
do some fun at home science,</text><text start="43.4" dur="2.7">and maybe we&amp;#39;ll have some
new friends in quarantine,</text><text start="46.1" dur="1.98">aka these bacterial cultures.</text><text start="48.08" dur="2.93">Two we wanna see if our
results will be consistent.</text><text start="51.01" dur="2.5">- Three, we really wanna
test homemade masks</text><text start="53.51" dur="2.51">because the ones in the pictures
look like surgical mask,</text><text start="56.02" dur="2.54">but I feel like a lot of people
just made their own at home,</text><text start="58.56" dur="2.62">like these ones, my mom
made that are super cool.</text><text start="61.18" dur="3.4">She just basically put two
layers of cotton fabric together</text><text start="64.58" dur="1.44">and some elastics on them.</text><text start="66.02" dur="1.53">Mom, you did an amazing job,</text><text start="67.55" dur="2.46">I feel like a science superhero
walking down the street.</text><text start="70.01" dur="1.71">So yeah, there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of them,</text><text start="71.72" dur="0.84">should she start a line?</text><text start="72.56" dur="0.86">Now, just before we start,</text><text start="73.42" dur="3.13">I know some of you might be
screaming at your screen saying,</text><text start="76.55" dur="4.43">but Mitch Coronavirus is
a virus, not a bacteria.</text><text start="80.98" dur="1.43">And that&amp;#39;s totally true,</text><text start="82.41" dur="2.9">so let us explain why this
experiment is still relevant.</text><text start="85.31" dur="2.39">- Right now scientists believe
that the main mechanism</text><text start="87.7" dur="3.27">of transmission for SARS CoV-2 virus</text><text start="90.97" dur="1.78">is through respiratory droplets.</text><text start="92.75" dur="1.43">The virus doesn&amp;#39;t just float around,</text><text start="94.18" dur="3.51">it relies on moisture from
an infected person to trap.</text><text start="97.69" dur="3.07">And given that bacteria from
the mouth, nose and throat</text><text start="100.76" dur="3.08">travel in the same way, while
these dishes aren&amp;#39;t gonna</text><text start="103.84" dur="3.19">show us how much SARS
CoV-2 virus is on them,</text><text start="107.03" dur="2.98">it will show us the
relative amount of droplets.</text><text start="110.01" dur="3.72">And these droplets by proxy
are telling us how our germs</text><text start="113.73" dur="3.57">spread, whether we&amp;#39;re wearing
a mask or not wearing a mask.</text><text start="117.3" dur="2.17">- As an added bonus, I
actually got some friends</text><text start="119.47" dur="2.27">who work in a lab at the
University of Toronto,</text><text start="121.74" dur="2.31">who are also going to
recreate this experiment</text><text start="124.05" dur="2.95">with us at the same time,
but under even more ideal</text><text start="127" dur="1.61">conditions for the bacteria to grow,</text><text start="128.61" dur="1.27">which we&amp;#39;ll get to in a bit.</text><text start="129.88" dur="2.14">Ultimately, all this is
to test and figure out</text><text start="132.02" dur="1.62">how well masks work.</text><text start="133.64" dur="3.1">Okay, so we are here with our agar plates,</text><text start="136.74" dur="2.43">I&amp;#39;ve got gloves on, these
have been sterilized,</text><text start="139.17" dur="2.24">we actually got them
from our friend, Amanda</text><text start="141.41" dur="2.14">who works in a lab who
was able to prep these</text><text start="143.55" dur="3.49">in a proper autoclave, and
we&amp;#39;ve sterilized this countertop</text><text start="147.04" dur="1.97">and we&amp;#39;re trying to be super
careful because we only wanna</text><text start="149.01" dur="2.2">see what&amp;#39;s actually
coming out of my mouth.</text><text start="151.21" dur="1.29">- [Narrator] Hot.
- Hot.</text><text start="152.5" dur="2.1">These are called LB plates.</text><text start="154.6" dur="3.31">Basically it means that
the agar that&amp;#39;s in them</text><text start="157.91" dur="1.84">is going to help the bacteria thrive.</text><text start="159.75" dur="2.3">There&amp;#39;s other kinds
that help fungus thrive,</text><text start="162.05" dur="1.97">but in this case, we wanna
see the bacteria come up</text><text start="164.02" dur="1.68">cause that&amp;#39;s mostly what&amp;#39;s
gonna come out of my mouth.</text><text start="165.7" dur="1.67">- [Narrator] Once we had
all the plates ready to go,</text><text start="167.37" dur="1.79">we began the experiment.</text><text start="169.16" dur="3.49">We held each plate around
1.5 feet away from the face</text><text start="172.65" dur="2.32">and coughed twice on one,
(coughs)</text><text start="174.97" dur="1.89">sneezed twice on one,
(sneezes)</text><text start="176.86" dur="2.82">a fake sneeze had to suffice,
talked for one minute to one.</text><text start="179.68" dur="3.75">- There&amp;#39;s hydrogen and helium
then lithium, beryllium.</text><text start="183.43" dur="1.676">- And sung for one minute to one.</text><text start="185.106" dur="4.004">♪ There&amp;#39;s hydrogen and helium
then lithium, beryllium. ♪</text><text start="189.11" dur="2.13">- Finally, we then repeated
all of these activities</text><text start="191.24" dur="1.891">with a mask on.
(coughs then sneezes)</text><text start="193.131" dur="1.825">- This is the periodic table</text><text start="194.956" dur="1.744">♪ The noble gas is stable ♪</text><text start="196.7" dur="1.7">Now that we have all our samples done,</text><text start="198.4" dur="1.56">we&amp;#39;re gonna keep them in this room</text><text start="199.96" dur="1.94">which is the warmest room in our house,</text><text start="201.9" dur="1.94">I&amp;#39;m literally like sweating right now.</text><text start="203.84" dur="3.571">All the bacteria, eats up all
that agar goodness and grows,</text><text start="207.411" dur="2.093">and then we&amp;#39;ll just come
back and check on them soon.</text><text start="209.504" dur="2.471">- [Narrator] One week later.</text><text start="211.975" dur="2.845">- Now because we don&amp;#39;t have
an incubator in our home,</text><text start="214.82" dur="2.33">obviously, our samples
will grow pretty slowly,</text><text start="217.15" dur="2.43">so I enlisted the help of
some friends who work at the</text><text start="219.58" dur="2.55">Molecular Genetics Department
at the University of Toronto</text><text start="222.13" dur="2.16">who are going to duplicate this experiment</text><text start="224.29" dur="1.55">under even more ideal conditions.</text><text start="225.84" dur="1.35">Of course, because of COVID-19,</text><text start="227.19" dur="1.33">we weren&amp;#39;t allowed to go in the lab,</text><text start="228.52" dur="1.334">so they&amp;#39;re gonna walk
me through the important</text><text start="229.854" dur="1.396">differences right now.</text><text start="231.25" dur="2.93">- At the lab, we&amp;#39;ve used
Brucella Blood Agar plates.</text><text start="234.18" dur="2.63">Brucella is a type of
media and it&amp;#39;s supplemented</text><text start="236.81" dur="2.94">with sheep&amp;#39;s blood, heme and vitamin K,</text><text start="239.75" dur="3.37">and these are additional
nutrients that a lot of organisms</text><text start="243.12" dur="2.07">in the microbiota need to grow.</text><text start="245.19" dur="1.603">- That won&amp;#39;t necessarily
change the result,</text><text start="246.793" dur="3.777">it will just help to
amplify any of the bacteria</text><text start="250.57" dur="1.262">that are actually coming out of me, right?</text><text start="251.832" dur="3.118">- Absolutely, we would expect
to see the exact same results</text><text start="254.95" dur="1.9">at home as in the lab,</text><text start="256.85" dur="2.65">except we might be seeing
different species of bacteria</text><text start="259.5" dur="2.03">growing on our home
plates than we are in lab,</text><text start="261.53" dur="2.83">and in the lab we&amp;#39;re giving
them a lot more nutrients</text><text start="264.36" dur="2.13">and a lot more conditions to
help them grow even better.</text><text start="266.49" dur="2.93">- Also in the lab I know
that or using an incubator,</text><text start="269.42" dur="2.95">why is an incubator useful
and what does it actually do?</text><text start="272.37" dur="4.09">- So we typically grow bacteria
in a 37-degree incubator,</text><text start="276.46" dur="3.66">and this is because our bodies
hover around 37 degrees,</text><text start="280.12" dur="1.72">assuming you have no fever.</text><text start="281.84" dur="2.86">And so any microbe that
grows inside the body</text><text start="284.7" dur="2.47">grow the best at 37 degrees.</text><text start="287.17" dur="2.3">- What do we actually expect
to grow on these plates</text><text start="289.47" dur="1.504">and is any of it dangerous?</text><text start="290.974" dur="2.586">- In general what you&amp;#39;re
going to see is just</text><text start="293.56" dur="3.56">the commensal, normal
everyday bacteria and fungi</text><text start="297.12" dur="1.23">that you have within us.</text><text start="298.35" dur="3.147">And we need them, they
provide us our nutrients,</text><text start="301.497" dur="1.913">they help us digest our food,</text><text start="303.41" dur="2.39">they help protect us against
other bacteria and fungi</text><text start="305.8" dur="1.45">that are trying to cause us harm.</text><text start="307.25" dur="3.577">Most of them are really
helpful and also friendly.</text><text start="310.827" dur="1.297">- Yeah, they&amp;#39;re our friends.</text><text start="312.124" dur="1.606">That&amp;#39;s really cute,
it&amp;#39;s nice to know that.</text><text start="313.73" dur="2.49">- One other big thing to remember is that</text><text start="316.22" dur="3.66">we actually can&amp;#39;t see viruses
growing on plates in a lab</text><text start="319.88" dur="2.59">or even at home, and
that&amp;#39;s just because viruses</text><text start="322.47" dur="1.43">are so small.</text><text start="323.9" dur="3.13">So while this experiment is
a great experiment at giving</text><text start="327.03" dur="3.396">a snapshot of what could
be in your droplets,</text><text start="330.426" dur="2.802">this will not include any
kinds of viruses and it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="333.228" dur="2.422">gonna include any types
of bacteria or fungi</text><text start="335.65" dur="2.57">that can&amp;#39;t grow in the
conditions we provided them in.</text><text start="338.22" dur="2.36">So it&amp;#39;s always gonna
be an underestimation.</text><text start="340.58" dur="2.233">- This is the most important question,</text><text start="342.813" dur="3.797">what will you be singing
to your Petri dishes?</text><text start="346.61" dur="2.22">- I thought long and hard about this,</text><text start="348.83" dur="3.38">and I&amp;#39;ve decided to go with
the classic karaoke song,</text><text start="352.21" dur="0.908">Uptown Girls.</text><text start="353.118" dur="1.578">- Yes.</text><text start="354.696" dur="1.885">- [Narrator] Three days later.</text><text start="356.581" dur="1.628">- As if we ever would say it like that.</text><text start="358.209" dur="1.011">(both laughing)</text><text start="359.22" dur="3.34">- Alright, so we are ready to
look at our results, we have..</text><text start="362.56" dur="2.474">- Say hello to our new little
friends, to our roommates.</text><text start="365.034" dur="2.686">- Our plates have been
growing for over a week,</text><text start="367.72" dur="1.73">maybe almost two now.
- I think it&amp;#39;s two weeks now.</text><text start="369.45" dur="2.009">- Whereas the laboratory
plates are only gonna</text><text start="371.459" dur="1.541">have been two days.</text><text start="373" dur="2.56">All right, shall we start with coughing?</text><text start="375.56" dur="3.97">The Petri dish for coughing,
there&amp;#39;s no colonies on the mask</text><text start="379.53" dur="2.68">Petri dish and there&amp;#39;s
one big chunker chunker</text><text start="382.21" dur="1.33">on the no-mask Petri dish.</text><text start="383.54" dur="1.89">- And maybe another little one over there</text><text start="385.43" dur="0.833">but yeah.
- Yeah,</text><text start="386.263" dur="2.687">with the lab results, we
see no bacterial cultures</text><text start="388.95" dur="2.9">when coughing with a mask,
and coughing without a mask,</text><text start="391.85" dur="2.17">we see one sort of
smacked up in the middle,</text><text start="394.02" dur="1.26">really good aim.</text><text start="395.28" dur="3.16">Coughing, we weren&amp;#39;t
sick, we had a dry cough.</text><text start="398.44" dur="1.23">I remember while doing it being like,</text><text start="399.67" dur="1.18">is on anything coming out?</text><text start="400.85" dur="2.68">- So the sneezing Petri
dishes are where we saw</text><text start="403.53" dur="1.33">the most difference.</text><text start="404.86" dur="3.88">So again, the masked sneeze
showed nothing on Petri dish,</text><text start="408.74" dur="4.43">but the unmasked sneeze
is out absolutely covered.</text><text start="413.17" dur="3.587">There&amp;#39;s probably, I don&amp;#39;t know,
50 little colonies growing?</text><text start="416.757" dur="0.833">- Hmm.</text><text start="417.59" dur="2.18">- Wow, I mean, obviously this is why,</text><text start="419.77" dur="1.81">even when there&amp;#39;s not a global pandemic,</text><text start="421.58" dur="1.48">you sneeze into your arm.</text><text start="423.06" dur="2.03">Why when people sneeze on the
subway you have a good reason</text><text start="425.09" dur="1.161">to be like, what?</text><text start="426.251" dur="1.419">- Cover your mouth.</text><text start="427.67" dur="2.23">And it&amp;#39;s just so much.</text><text start="429.9" dur="3.07">I&amp;#39;m so surprised as that nothing
seemingly made it through</text><text start="432.97" dur="2.53">on the masked one and yet
so much made it through</text><text start="435.5" dur="0.96">without a mask.</text><text start="436.46" dur="1.94">The lab results were also interesting,</text><text start="438.4" dur="2.506">no cultures when you had
a mask on with sneezing,</text><text start="440.906" dur="3.684">but then without the mask
tons all over the plate.</text><text start="444.59" dur="2.5">- The plates from talking,
we see without a mask,</text><text start="447.09" dur="1.77">there are about eight,</text><text start="448.86" dur="1.55">there&amp;#39;s quite a few colonies growing,</text><text start="450.41" dur="1.83">with the mask, there are none.</text><text start="452.24" dur="2.92">So I think this is really
striking because talking is</text><text start="455.16" dur="1.32">something that we are all doing.</text><text start="456.48" dur="2.048">Lab results show talking with the mask,</text><text start="458.528" dur="4.162">no bacterial cultures and
talking without a mask, a lot.</text><text start="462.69" dur="1.74">- Yeah, I know it&amp;#39;s actually surprising,</text><text start="464.43" dur="3.26">maybe almost as much as
the sneezing in this case.</text><text start="467.69" dur="2.71">- This is why it&amp;#39;s so important
that you have a mask on.</text><text start="470.4" dur="2.76">- It probably depends how much
enunciating we were doing.</text><text start="473.16" dur="2.95">- I was reading a study
where they actually analyzed</text><text start="476.11" dur="2.82">using computers and like
lasers, how many droplets</text><text start="478.93" dur="2.64">were coming out of people&amp;#39;s
mouths as they spoke,</text><text start="481.57" dur="3.873">and they got them to say stay
healthy because the T-H noise</text><text start="485.443" dur="2.527">is known to create a lot of droplets.</text><text start="487.97" dur="1.84">I think the T-H noise yeah.</text><text start="489.81" dur="4.15">- So singing we&amp;#39;re seeing
nothing on the masked version,</text><text start="493.96" dur="3.29">and we&amp;#39;re actually seeing quite
a few drops on the no mask.</text><text start="497.25" dur="2.35">Do not sing without a
mask right now people.</text><text start="499.6" dur="2.5">It&amp;#39;s pretty, it&amp;#39;s kind of
staggering, there&amp;#39;s probably</text><text start="502.1" dur="3.02">six to eight colonies
starting, some of them big.</text><text start="505.12" dur="1.623">And this makes sense when
you hear about how choirs</text><text start="506.743" dur="3.007">were spreading COVID and how
they&amp;#39;ve shut down Broadway</text><text start="509.75" dur="0.98">for good reason.</text><text start="510.73" dur="2.68">- Finally, in the lab with
singing nothing with the mask</text><text start="513.41" dur="2.12">and a lot without a mask.</text><text start="515.53" dur="2.51">So I&amp;#39;d be curious to see
what would happen if this had</text><text start="518.04" dur="0.89">a full week like ours, it could</text><text start="518.93" dur="1.3">probably cover the whole plate.</text><text start="520.23" dur="2.38">So these plates are helping
us to understand how much is</text><text start="522.61" dur="3.1">coming out of us and the
effectiveness of masks in stopping</text><text start="525.71" dur="3.82">those droplets and not necessarily
how effective the mask is</text><text start="529.53" dur="1.06">in protecting you.</text><text start="530.59" dur="1.15">So that&amp;#39;s just something to take in mind.</text><text start="531.74" dur="2.15">- Yeah, wearing a mask is altruistic,</text><text start="533.89" dur="2.9">it&amp;#39;s about you protecting
other people around you,</text><text start="536.79" dur="1.5">which I think is kind
of a beautiful thing.</text><text start="538.29" dur="1.15">I&amp;#39;m wearing this mask</text><text start="539.44" dur="1.007">for other people.
- For other people.</text><text start="540.447" dur="3.233">And I also just wanna say that
masks are potentially part</text><text start="543.68" dur="1.64">of the solution, but they&amp;#39;re
not the whole solution.</text><text start="545.32" dur="1.51">- Yeah.
- So, we should be very masks,</text><text start="546.83" dur="1.537">we should be washing our hands,</text><text start="548.367" dur="1.773">- Physically distancing.
- Yeah.</text><text start="550.14" dur="2.358">Isolating completely if
you&amp;#39;ve ever been exposed.</text><text start="552.498" dur="2.632">And then obviously we&amp;#39;re
all hoping that vaccines</text><text start="555.13" dur="1.49">and treatments come together.</text><text start="556.62" dur="2.66">And that is kind of like a
holistic look at how we can all</text><text start="559.28" dur="2.913">be working together to stop
the spread of this virus.</text><text start="563.85" dur="2.2">Now, if you love learning

and I&amp;#39;ve always wanted</text><text start="596.68" dur="2.35">to get better at producing
it in my own home.</text><text start="599.03" dur="2.17">So I actually took a

Italy and Switzerland is a restaurant.</text><text start="5.243" dur="3.911">For tourists visiting from around the world,
the Rifugio Guide del Cervino</text><text start="9.154" dur="4.096">offers a break from winter sports for food,
drinks, lodging</text><text start="13.25" dur="4.292">and as this reviewer called it: 
“A great Italian experience.”</text><text start="17.542" dur="2.314">But something unexpected is happening here.</text><text start="19.856" dur="2.821">The nearby Theodul Glacier is melting.</text><text start="22.677" dur="0.985">And as it does</text><text start="23.662" dur="5.286">this little Italian ski lodge is on the verge
of moving into Switzerland.</text><text start="36.395" dur="3.972">Most of Italy&amp;#39;s land border follows the watershed
along the Alps.</text><text start="40.367" dur="1.425">There is this imaginary line </text><text start="41.792" dur="3.444">that divides the water that falls in the Mediterranean Sea in the south.</text><text start="45.236" dur="2.879">Or in the north, into the Black Sea 
via the Dunabe.</text><text start="48.115" dur="1.475">Or to the North Sea.</text><text start="49.59" dur="1.253">That’s Marco Ferrari.</text><text start="50.843" dur="3.047">He wrote a book about this border 
with architect Andrea Bagnato</text><text start="53.89" dur="3.343">and visual designer Elisa Pasqual.</text><text start="57.233" dur="3.761">This watershed line traces many of the 
highest peaks of the Alps </text><text start="60.994" dur="2.523">forming a natural border between countries.</text><text start="63.517" dur="3.495">Much of it is marked by over 8,000
boundary stones like these.</text><text start="67.012" dur="2.803">Some of which have been around 
since the 16th century.</text><text start="71.12" dur="4.117">But in the most rugged terrain, where physical
markers are few and far between.</text><text start="75.237" dur="3.933">Swiss, Italian, and Austrian cartographic
agencies have long maintained</text><text start="79.17" dur="2.449">official border records with 
meticulous measurements</text><text start="81.619" dur="2.263">and annotated pictures like these.</text><text start="83.882" dur="2.288">Some of these areas are on top of glaciers.</text><text start="86.17" dur="2.17">Their surfaces are too reflective for satellites</text><text start="88.34" dur="2.119">which are often used to measure borders.</text><text start="90.459" dur="2.666">The work by the surveyors is done manually.</text><text start="93.125" dur="4.331">So every few years, there&amp;#39;s 
a commission of surveyors</text><text start="97.456" dur="2.984">composed of members of both countries</text><text start="100.44" dur="4.05">that actually walk the border and
look how it has changed.</text><text start="104.49" dur="4.329">As early as the 1920s, surveyors noticed a
“slow but progressive” shrinking</text><text start="108.819" dur="3.436">among glaciers, and that “some had disappeared&amp;quot;.</text><text start="112.255" dur="5.04">But by the 1990s, it became clear that summer
melt had outpaced winter accumulation.</text><text start="117.295" dur="4.714">The surveyors realized that the glaciers were
melting and not accumulating ice anymore.</text><text start="122.009" dur="5.918">This kind of cyclical change in the shape
and geometry of the watershed became </text><text start="127.927" dur="2.318">more and more permanent.</text><text start="130.245" dur="2.895">And as glaciers shifted so did the watershed</text><text start="133.14" dur="1.5">and so did the border.</text><text start="134.64" dur="2.516">Here’s what that looks like.</text><text start="137.156" dur="3.934">On many Alpine peaks, a glacier ridge forms
the watershed boundary line</text><text start="141.09" dur="2.056">and thus the national border.</text><text start="143.146" dur="3.214">But as those glaciers melt, their highest
point might shift</text><text start="146.36" dur="1.922">often dozens of meters away.</text><text start="148.282" dur="3.237">If they melt far enough, they even reveal
underlying rock peaks</text><text start="151.519" dur="2.309">which then become the border line.</text><text start="153.828" dur="4.759">These black X’s mark the old national boundary
between Italy and Switzerland.</text><text start="158.587" dur="4.072">But if you trace today’s national boundary
and compare it to old maps</text><text start="162.659" dur="3.547">you can see all the places where 
the boundary line has moved.</text><text start="166.206" dur="2.033">In the most extreme case yet in the Alps</text><text start="168.239" dur="4.143">shifts in the Theodul Glacier moved the border
150 meters.</text><text start="172.382" dur="3.749">That put this Italian ski lift on Swiss soil.</text><text start="176.131" dur="4.644">And the Rifugio Guide del Cervino 
might be next.</text><text start="180.775" dur="4.015">Typically when countries renegotiate borders,
there’s a careful process to make sure</text><text start="184.79" dur="3.457">that neither country gains territory 
at the other’s expense.</text><text start="188.247" dur="2.953">But recently, Italy signed a new type of agreement.</text><text start="191.2" dur="4.409">First with Austria in 2006, and then with
Switzerland in 2009.</text><text start="195.609" dur="2.63">That recognized the Alps as a “mobile border&amp;quot;.</text><text start="198.239" dur="3.435">Acknowledging that the border was subject
to changes in the natural world </text><text start="201.674" dur="1.795">outside of those countries’ control.</text><text start="204.893" dur="3.042">Fortunately, the Rifugio is 
the only inhabited place</text><text start="207.935" dur="1.727">along this shifting border.</text><text start="209.662" dur="4.277">And if it becomes Swiss, it’ll be subject
to Swiss law, taxes, and customs.</text><text start="213.939" dur="2.372">They might have to change their wall plugs.</text><text start="216.311" dur="3.427">But for most nearby residents, the changes
won’t mean much.</text><text start="219.738" dur="3.371">But if we think about different areas of the
world where similar processes are happening</text><text start="223.109" dur="5.878">for example, the Himalaya or the Andes, these
is a completely different geopolitical situations</text><text start="228.987" dur="4.263">in which also the scale of the phenomenon
is much, much bigger,</text><text start="233.25" dur="2.185">the histories are much more conflicted.</text><text start="235.435" dur="3.125">In the Himalayas, China and India 
disagree about their border</text><text start="238.56" dur="3.882">and have fought several times over it as it
continues to melt and shift.</text><text start="242.442" dur="4.5">And in the Andes, Chile and Argentina have
long disagreed about their own melting border.</text><text start="246.942" dur="3.471">As climate change warms the planet 
and moves water-based borders</text><text start="250.413" dur="2.082">these conflicts could worsen.</text><text start="252.495" dur="4.497">Rivers, which make up over a third of the
length of all international land boundaries</text><text start="256.992" dur="3.337">will be subject to extreme events 
that can change their course.</text><text start="260.329" dur="1.971">Coastlines will give way to rising seas</text><text start="262.3" dur="3.036">affecting exclusive economic zones, where
a country’s sovereignty </text><text start="265.336" dur="1.831">extends into the ocean.</text><text start="267.167" dur="3.063">And glaciers, like in the Alps, 
will continue to melt.</text><text start="270.23" dur="3.554">The alpine mobile border is almost like 
a laboratory</text><text start="273.784" dur="4.235">a prototype of a condition that will happen
more and more</text><text start="278.019" dur="2.716">in a lot of different parts of the world.</text><text start="286.252" dur="1.438">Keep going!</text></transcript>

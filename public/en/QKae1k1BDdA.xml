<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="7.034" dur="2.56">Before empires and royalty,</text><text start="9.594" dur="2.17">before pottery and writing,</text><text start="11.764" dur="2.54">before metal tools and weapons –</text><text start="14.304" dur="1.79">there was cheese.</text><text start="16.094" dur="2.88">As early as 8000 BCE,</text><text start="18.974" dur="4.07">the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent</text><text start="23.044" dur="2.43">began a legacy of cheesemaking</text><text start="25.474" dur="3.71">almost as old as civilization itself.</text><text start="29.184" dur="4.016">The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats,</text><text start="33.2" dur="2.91">which ancient farmers harvested for milk.</text><text start="36.11" dur="3.43">But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours,</text><text start="39.54" dur="2.62">that fresh milk began to sour.</text><text start="42.16" dur="5.58">Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps.</text><text start="47.74" dur="2.78">Upon discovering this 
strange transformation,</text><text start="50.52" dur="2.63">the farmers drained the remaining liquid –</text><text start="53.15" dur="1.61">later named whey –</text><text start="54.76" dur="6.75">and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal.</text><text start="61.512" dur="4.43">These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese,</text><text start="65.942" dur="4.66">which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed</text><text start="70.602" dur="4.52">into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights.</text><text start="75.122" dur="4.606">The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage.</text><text start="79.728" dur="4.74">Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals.</text><text start="84.468" dur="3.68">But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose –</text><text start="88.148" dur="5.27">a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs.</text><text start="93.418" dur="5.71">Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose.</text><text start="99.128" dur="2.96">And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled,</text><text start="102.088" dur="2.39">these essential nutrients could be eaten</text><text start="104.478" dur="3.95">throughout scarce famines 
and long winters.</text><text start="108.428" dur="4.132">Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey</text><text start="112.56" dur="4.73">still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held.</text><text start="117.29" dur="1.7">By the end of the Bronze Age,</text><text start="118.99" dur="3.06">cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade</text><text start="122.05" dur="2.43">throughout the eastern Mediterranean.</text><text start="124.48" dur="3.22">In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia,</text><text start="127.7" dur="3.55">cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life.</text><text start="131.25" dur="2">Some of the earliest known writing</text><text start="133.25" dur="3.09">includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas,</text><text start="136.34" dur="4.1">listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations</text><text start="140.44" dur="1.775">across Mesopotamia.</text><text start="142.215" dur="5.13">Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet.</text><text start="147.345" dur="3.995">This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals,</text><text start="151.34" dur="4.165">can accelerate and control coagulation.</text><text start="155.505" dur="4.72">Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe,</text><text start="160.225" dur="3.96">giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses.</text><text start="164.185" dur="4.06">And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy,</text><text start="168.245" dur="5.86">many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors.</text><text start="174.105" dur="6.777">Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag.</text><text start="180.882" dur="6.411">Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats.</text><text start="187.293" dur="4.33">In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids,</text><text start="191.623" dur="3.01">such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt</text><text start="194.633" dur="3.67">and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer.</text><text start="198.303" dur="3.92">This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces,</text><text start="202.223" dur="3.68">or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish.</text><text start="205.903" dur="4">The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese,</text><text start="209.903" dur="4.66">alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano.</text><text start="214.563" dur="2.615">This grating cheese was produced in Sicily</text><text start="217.178" dur="3.98">and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean.</text><text start="221.158" dur="4.139">Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,”</text><text start="225.297" dur="1.56">became an essential ration</text><text start="226.857" dur="6.54">for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire.</text><text start="233.397" dur="2.841">And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed,</text><text start="236.238" dur="2.07">cheesemaking continued to evolve</text><text start="238.308" dur="4.08">in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside.</text><text start="242.388" dur="3.974">In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe,</text><text start="246.362" dur="4.51">medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk,</text><text start="250.872" dur="1.35">cheesemaking practices,</text><text start="252.222" dur="4.98">and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses.</text><text start="257.202" dur="3.753">Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types</text><text start="260.955" dur="5.13">were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen.</text><text start="266.085" dur="3.73">In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful –</text><text start="269.815" dur="3.082">producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses.</text><text start="272.897" dur="1.84">By the end of the 14th century,</text><text start="274.737" dur="4.99">Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable</text><text start="279.727" dur="3.37">that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands</text><text start="283.097" dur="3.41">to take control of the growing 
cheese trade.</text><text start="286.507" dur="2.73">Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance,</text><text start="289.237" dur="3.74">and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery</text><text start="292.977" dur="1.61">and into machinery.</text><text start="294.587" dur="5.06">Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year,</text><text start="299.647" dur="2.68">shipped and consumed around the globe.</text><text start="302.327" dur="2.77">But 10,000 years after its invention,</text><text start="305.097" dur="5.28">local farms are still following in the 
footsteps of their Neolithic ancestors,</text><text start="310.377" dur="4.08">hand crafting one of humanity’s 
oldest and favorite foods.</text></transcript>

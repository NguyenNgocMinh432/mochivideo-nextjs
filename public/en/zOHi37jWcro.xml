Hi, I&amp;#39;m Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.</text><text start="4.18" dur="5.52">Are you ready to expand your vocabulary? Let&amp;#39;s
talk about it.</text><text start="9.7" dur="6.569">Vanessa:
Last week I shared a 90 minute English conversation</text><text start="16.269" dur="6.14">between my husband, Dan and I, where we talked
about 12 different topics. In this way, you</text><text start="22.409" dur="5.18">could immerse yourself in English for an hour
and a half, and learn over 200 new expressions.</text><text start="27.589" dur="6.611">In today&amp;#39;s lesson, I&amp;#39;m going to take 25 of
those expressions and explain them in detail.</text><text start="34.2" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;ll be explaining each new expression and
then after my explanation, you&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="39.27" dur="4.85">see a clip from the original conversation
with Dan. If you haven&amp;#39;t watched that conversation</text><text start="44.12" dur="1.64">and make sure you do that.
Vanessa:</text><text start="45.76" dur="6.77">Let&amp;#39;s get started with the first one. Number
one: To look like. To look like. In the conversation</text><text start="52.53" dur="7.41">with Dan, I said, &amp;quot;I mostly look like my mom,&amp;quot;
and this is talking about my physical appearance.</text><text start="59.94" dur="8.49">I resemble my mom. Or we could say, &amp;quot;It looks
like it&amp;#39;s going to rain. The sky looks similar</text><text start="68.43" dur="5.17">to the way that it looks when it&amp;#39;s going to
rain.&amp;quot; So we have two things that look similar.</text><text start="73.6" dur="6.97">&amp;quot;It looks like it&amp;#39;s going to rain,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I
mostly look like my mom.&amp;quot; Let&amp;#39;s take a look</text><text start="80.57" dur="3.79">at the clip from the original conversation
so that you can see how it was used.</text><text start="84.36" dur="3.89">Dan:
So appearance, I look mostly like my mom,</text><text start="88.25" dur="1">I think.
Vanessa:</text><text start="89.25" dur="1">Okay.
Dan:</text><text start="90.25" dur="6.44">I have more of her skin tone. I have her eyes.
So appearance, I look mostly like my mom,</text><text start="96.69" dur="1">I think.
Vanessa:</text><text start="97.69" dur="1">Okay.
Dan:</text><text start="98.69" dur="3.12">I have more of her skin tone. I have her eyes
Vanessa:</text><text start="101.81" dur="10.34">Number two: To a T. To a T. What is T? This
is an idiom and it means perfectly. Exactly.</text><text start="112.15" dur="7.46">If we say, &amp;quot;She looks like her mom to a T,&amp;quot;
that means she looks like her mom exactly.</text><text start="119.61" dur="5.6">We often use this to talk about directions
or to follow some instructions. So the teacher</text><text start="125.21" dur="6.971">might say, &amp;quot;You need to follow these instructions
to a T. If you don&amp;#39;t follow them to a T, you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="132.181" dur="6.388">going to fail the exam.&amp;quot; So you need to follow
the instructions exactly. Follow them to a</text><text start="138.569" dur="2.341">T. Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the clip from the
conversation.</text><text start="140.91" dur="2.77">Vanessa:
I think I look a lot like my mom.</text><text start="143.68" dur="2.27">Dan:
Yeah, she looks exactly like her mom. They&amp;#39;re</text><text start="145.95" dur="1.17">like to a T.
Vanessa:</text><text start="147.12" dur="2.699">I think I look a lot like my mom.
Dan:</text><text start="149.819" dur="2.471">Yeah, she looks exactly like her mom. They&amp;#39;re
like to a T.</text><text start="152.29" dur="3.89">Vanessa:
Number three: Off the charts. This is a fun</text><text start="156.18" dur="7.61">idiom and it means more than expected. Dan
said, &amp;quot;Her enthusiasm was off the charts.&amp;quot;</text><text start="163.79" dur="4">We can imagine that maybe you&amp;#39;re in some kind
of business meeting and there&amp;#39;s a chart that</text><text start="167.79" dur="5.75">shows some progress of the product that you&amp;#39;re
selling, and then all of a sudden the line</text><text start="173.54" dur="5.98">goes off the chart. That means that it was
more than you expected. You didn&amp;#39;t even have</text><text start="179.52" dur="4.969">a chart big enough to show the growth of that
product, but it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be a product</text><text start="184.489" dur="5.97">that we talk about. Instead, it could be enthusiasm.
&amp;quot;Her enthusiasm was a way more than I expected.</text><text start="190.459" dur="5.521">It was off the charts.&amp;quot; It doesn&amp;#39;t need to
be a positive thing though. You could say,</text><text start="195.98" dur="7.369">&amp;quot;Our heating bill was off the charts last
month.&amp;quot; That means it was so high that I could</text><text start="203.349" dur="6.211">have never expected that it would be so high.
&amp;quot;Our heating bill was off the charts. It was</text><text start="209.56" dur="1.259">incredibly high.&amp;quot;
Vanessa:</text><text start="210.819" dur="1.761">All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the original clip.
Dan:</text><text start="212.58" dur="1.2">She was like bouncing.
Vanessa:</text><text start="213.78" dur="1.77">I always have a lot of enthusiasm. That&amp;#39;s
true.</text><text start="215.55" dur="2.73">Dan:
It was off the charts. She was like bouncing.</text><text start="218.28" dur="1.679">Vanessa:
I always have a lot of enthusiasm. That&amp;#39;s</text><text start="219.959" dur="1">true.
Dan:</text><text start="220.959" dur="1.691">Yes, it was off the charts.
Vanessa:</text><text start="222.65" dur="9.559">Number four: A gray area. The word gray, this
color, it&amp;#39;s not black, it&amp;#39;s not white, it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="232.209" dur="5.551">in the middle. So we&amp;#39;re talking about something
that&amp;#39;s not clearly defined. It&amp;#39;s not black</text><text start="237.76" dur="6.52">and white. It&amp;#39;s gray. In the conversation
with Dan, we said that, &amp;quot;The area between</text><text start="244.28" dur="6.67">childhood and adulthood is kind of a gray
area. It&amp;#39;s not that one day you wake up and</text><text start="250.95" dur="5.179">you&amp;#39;re an adult. No, it&amp;#39;s kind of a gray area.&amp;quot;
There are a lot of things in life that are</text><text start="256.129" dur="6.781">not clearly defined, especially when it comes
to values or morals. So you might say, &amp;quot;Sharing</text><text start="262.91" dur="6.59">pictures of your child on social media is
a gray area. Some people think it&amp;#39;s not a</text><text start="269.5" dur="4.86">good thing. Some people think it is a good
thing. Some people feel like, I don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="274.36" dur="5.57">what to think. It&amp;#39;s kind of undefined. This
is a new territory for new parents.&amp;quot; This</text><text start="279.93" dur="4.7">is a gray area. All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the
original clips that you can see how it was</text><text start="284.63" dur="1">used.
Vanessa:</text><text start="285.63" dur="4.22">Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just
making your own decisions, but we still need</text><text start="289.85" dur="3.129">help from other people as adults, so it&amp;#39;s
a gray area.</text><text start="292.979" dur="1.071">Dan:
Sure. Yeah.</text><text start="294.05" dur="2.97">Vanessa:
Yeah. It&amp;#39;s not so clear. I think you can still</text><text start="297.02" dur="4.72">be an adult just making your own decisions,
but we still need help from other people as</text><text start="301.74" dur="2.429">adults, so it&amp;#39;s a gray area.
Dan:</text><text start="304.169" dur="1.081">Sure. Yeah.
Vanessa:</text><text start="305.25" dur="1.82">It&amp;#39;s not so clear.
Vanessa:</text><text start="307.07" dur="7.34">Number five: To be paid under the table. Does
this mean that Dan&amp;#39;s boss literally gave him</text><text start="314.41" dur="7.8">money under the table? No. This just means
that he was paid illegally. He wasn&amp;#39;t officially</text><text start="322.21" dur="7.59">on a register as an employee of that restaurant.
Instead, they just gave him cash. To be paid</text><text start="329.8" dur="5.44">under the table. When he said, &amp;quot;I was paid
under the table,&amp;quot; that was most likely because</text><text start="335.24" dur="6.62">of his age. I think he was probably too young
to be officially an employee, and that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="341.86" dur="5.559">of common in the US that if you get a job
when you&amp;#39;re too young, the boss will probably</text><text start="347.419" dur="7.5">just pay you in cash under the table, or if
you have an odd job. Odd jobs are often paid</text><text start="354.919" dur="5.821">under the table. If you&amp;#39;re babysitter, if
you walk your neighbor&amp;#39;s dog you&amp;#39;re not going</text><text start="360.74" dur="6.5">to get a tax form that says you are the babysitter
for this person. No, it&amp;#39;s just between two</text><text start="367.24" dur="4.55">people. They just give you cash, or maybe
they write you a little check, a personal</text><text start="371.79" dur="2.03">check. It&amp;#39;s paid under the table.
Vanessa:</text><text start="373.82" dur="2.78">All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you
can see how this was used.</text><text start="376.6" dur="1.599">Vanessa:
Things you don&amp;#39;t want to know when you visit</text><text start="378.199" dur="1">a restaurant.
Dan:</text><text start="379.199" dur="1.631">And I was was paid under the table.
Vanessa:</text><text start="380.83" dur="1">Oh really?
Dan:</text><text start="381.83" dur="1">Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Vanessa:</text><text start="382.83" dur="1.11">Why did they have to pay you under the table?
Dan:</text><text start="383.94" dur="1.199">I don&amp;#39;t know.
Vanessa:</text><text start="385.139" dur="2.041">Things you don&amp;#39;t want to know when you visit
a restaurant.</text><text start="387.18" dur="1.799">Dan:
And I was paid under the table.</text><text start="388.979" dur="1">Vanessa:
Oh really?</text><text start="389.979" dur="1">Dan:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).</text><text start="390.979" dur="1">Vanessa:
Why&amp;#39;d they have to pay you under the table?</text><text start="391.979" dur="1">Dan:
I don&amp;#39;t know.</text><text start="392.979" dur="4.44">Vanessa:
Number six: The meat. This is a little bit</text><text start="397.419" dur="8.351">of a funny metaphor here. We&amp;#39;re not talking
about meat like chicken or beef or pork. Instead,</text><text start="405.77" dur="7.1">we&amp;#39;re talking about the majority of something.
Usually we talk about the majority of money</text><text start="412.87" dur="1.43">or of revenue.
Vanessa:</text><text start="414.3" dur="7.33">So Dan said that, &amp;quot;The meat of our tourism
is nature in the US. Yeah, people go to New</text><text start="421.63" dur="6.72">York or LA, but a lot of people visit the
US to see nature. This is the majority of</text><text start="428.35" dur="9.659">our tourism. The meat of our tourism.&amp;quot; Or
you might say, &amp;quot;Selling pottery is the meat</text><text start="438.009" dur="8.332">of the craft shops revenue. A craft shop might
sell quilted things, or knitted scarves, or</text><text start="446.341" dur="6.679">paintings, or pottery, but if they sell a
lot of pottery, if the pottery is really what</text><text start="453.02" dur="6.9">helps them to pay the bills, then that&amp;#39;s the
meat of their revenue.&amp;quot; We might say, &amp;quot;Selling</text><text start="459.92" dur="5.13">pottery is the meat of the craft shops revenue.&amp;quot;
All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you</text><text start="465.05" dur="2.19">can see how this expression was used.
Vanessa:</text><text start="467.24" dur="3.13">I feel like a lot of tourism is natural tourism.
Dan:</text><text start="470.37" dur="2.75">Yeah. The meat of our tourism is nature.
Vanessa:</text><text start="473.12" dur="3.33">I feel like a lot of tourism is natural tourism.
Dan:</text><text start="476.45" dur="2.86">Yeah. The meat of our tourism is nature.
Vanessa:</text><text start="479.31" dur="6.44">Number seven: To crash somewhere. This doesn&amp;#39;t
mean that you&amp;#39;re breaking or destroying something.</text><text start="485.75" dur="5.87">Instead, it&amp;#39;s just an informal expression
that means you&amp;#39;re going to arrive somewhere.</text><text start="491.62" dur="7.19">It doesn&amp;#39;t need to be arriving somewhere uninvited,
but it does have this casual feeling to it.</text><text start="498.81" dur="6.359">So we could say, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re going to crash their
vacation.&amp;quot; Dan and I were talking about how</text><text start="505.169" dur="5.961">his parents have a vacation planned to go
to Hawaii, and he was trying to scheme a way</text><text start="511.13" dur="6.269">that we can go, they can watch our kids, and
we can go and have fun on vacation. This is</text><text start="517.399" dur="5.77">not a positive situation. This isn&amp;#39;t really
probably going to happen, but we said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re</text><text start="523.169" dur="6.23">going to crash their vacation.&amp;quot; We&amp;#39;re going
to arrive informally and kind of break into</text><text start="529.399" dur="6.3">the middle of their vacation and change their
plans. Or we could use this in a less extreme</text><text start="535.699" dur="6.13">and just say, &amp;quot;If you need somewhere to stay,
feel free to crash at my house.&amp;quot;</text><text start="541.829" dur="3.41">Vanessa:
Maybe if you&amp;#39;re taking a long road trip and</text><text start="545.239" dur="4.52">halfway through the road trip you&amp;#39;re going
to be passing near where one of your friends</text><text start="549.759" dur="5.88">lives. That friend might say, &amp;quot;Oh, it&amp;#39;s too
far to go in one day. You can just stop at</text><text start="555.639" dur="5.94">my house and then drive the next day.&amp;quot; So
you might say, &amp;quot;You can crash at my house.&amp;quot;</text><text start="561.579" dur="6.93">This means you can sleep there, you can just
relax because driving all that distance in</text><text start="568.509" dur="4.471">one day is too much. &amp;quot;Feel free to crash at
my house if you need to.&amp;quot; All right, let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="572.98" dur="3.12">watch the clips that you can see how this
fun expression was used.</text><text start="576.1" dur="1.889">Dan:
But if my parents are there-</text><text start="577.989" dur="1.231">Vanessa:
They can watch our kids.</text><text start="579.22" dur="1.169">Dan:
They can watch the kids!</text><text start="580.389" dur="2.45">Vanessa:
So we&amp;#39;re going to crash their vacation and</text><text start="582.839" dur="2.081">make them watch our kids?
Dan:</text><text start="584.92" dur="1.659">But if my parents are there-
Vanessa:</text><text start="586.579" dur="1.141">They can watch the kids.
Dan:</text><text start="587.72" dur="1">They can watch the kids!
Vanessa:</text><text start="588.72" dur="3.919">So we&amp;#39;re going to crash their vacation and
make them watch our kids?</text><text start="592.639" dur="4.681">Vanessa:
Number eight: You can&amp;#39;t go wrong with. This</text><text start="597.32" dur="5.97">means that it&amp;#39;s impossible to make a bad decision
about something. So I said, &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t go</text><text start="603.29" dur="6.349">wrong with salmon. Salmon is a tasty food.
Really any way that you cook it is going to</text><text start="609.639" dur="5.44">be great.&amp;quot; So I said, &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t go wrong
with salmon.&amp;quot; Or if there&amp;#39;s something else</text><text start="615.079" dur="5.51">that everybody loves, it&amp;#39;s impossible to do
it incorrectly. You might say, &amp;quot;Oh, you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="620.589" dur="5.71">go wrong with a beach vacation. The beach
will always be nice. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text><text start="626.299" dur="3.931">your plans are. If you just want to chill
on the beach, or if you want to do a lot of</text><text start="630.23" dur="5.57">stuff, or go alone, or go with a lot of people,
you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with a beach vacation.&amp;quot;</text><text start="635.8" dur="4.649">I hope you feel that way about my lessons.
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t go wrong with Vanessa&amp;#39;s lessons.&amp;quot;</text><text start="640.449" dur="4.45">That means that any lesson that you watch,
you&amp;#39;ll learn a lot and hopefully have a good</text><text start="644.899" dur="4.09">time. All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that
you can see how this expression was used.</text><text start="648.989" dur="2.361">Vanessa:
Ah, yeah. Well, I think you can&amp;#39;t go wrong</text><text start="651.35" dur="1">with Salmon.
Dan:</text><text start="652.35" dur="4.179">Yeah, but it&amp;#39;s just a very healthy meal that
tastes very filling and fulfilling.</text><text start="656.529" dur="2.631">Vanessa:
Ah, yeah. Well, I think you can&amp;#39;t go wrong</text><text start="659.16" dur="1">with salmon.
Dan:</text><text start="660.16" dur="4.359">Yeah, but it&amp;#39;s just a very healthy meal that
tastes very filling and fulfilling.</text><text start="664.519" dur="5.211">Vanessa:
Number nine: To make it work. To make it work.</text><text start="669.73" dur="6.829">Does this have to do with going to work and
having a job? No. Instead, we&amp;#39;re talking about</text><text start="676.559" dur="7.291">succeeding even though there&amp;#39;s some difficulties.
So when we were talking about our office space</text><text start="683.85" dur="7.079">that we used to film in, Dan said, &amp;quot;We made
it work.&amp;quot; That means we made the small space</text><text start="690.929" dur="7.551">of the office acceptable for what we needed.
&amp;quot;We made it work. The small space was difficult,</text><text start="698.48" dur="4.38">but we still tried to succeed.&amp;quot; We made it
work. Or if you want to have a little bit</text><text start="702.86" dur="5.509">of a longer sentence, you might say, &amp;quot;Having
a long distance relationship is really tough,</text><text start="708.369" dur="7.851">but we will make it work.&amp;quot; If your boyfriend
is planning to 300 miles away and you&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="716.22" dur="4.619">going to see him as often, you might say,
&amp;quot;Oh yeah, it&amp;#39;s so tough to have a long distance</text><text start="720.839" dur="5.62">relationship, but don&amp;#39;t worry we will make
it work. We are going to succeed despite the</text><text start="726.459" dur="1.98">difficulties.&amp;quot; All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the
clip.</text><text start="728.439" dur="1.661">Dan:
She used to film in a closet.</text><text start="730.1" dur="3.279">Vanessa:
It wasn&amp;#39;t a closet, but it was a really small.</text><text start="733.379" dur="1.591">Dan:
Two closets combined.</text><text start="734.97" dur="1.799">Vanessa:
Yeah, it was like a little triangle room.</text><text start="736.769" dur="1">Dan:
It was very small.</text><text start="737.769" dur="1">Vanessa:
But-</text><text start="738.769" dur="1">Dan:
Hey, we made it work.</text><text start="739.769" dur="1">Vanessa:
Yeah. It worked. We made it work.</text><text start="740.769" dur="1.401">Dan:
She used to film in a closet.</text><text start="742.17" dur="2.68">Vanessa:
It wasn&amp;#39;t a closet, but it was a really small.</text><text start="744.85" dur="1.219">Dan:
Two closets combined.</text><text start="746.069" dur="2.64">Vanessa:
Yeah, it was like a little triangle room.</text><text start="748.709" dur="1">Dan:
It was very small.</text><text start="749.709" dur="1">Vanessa:
But-</text><text start="750.709" dur="1">Dan:
Hey we made it work.</text><text start="751.709" dur="1.021">Vanessa:
Yeah. It worked. We made it work.</text><text start="752.73" dur="4.63">Vanessa:
Number 10: Where on earth? This is a fun,</text><text start="757.36" dur="6.319">shocked statement. Where on earth did you
hear that? It means that you are completely</text><text start="763.679" dur="4.371">shocked that someone said something to you.
Where on earth did you hear that? That sounds</text><text start="768.05" dur="5.499">like it&amp;#39;s absolutely crazy. Or if you get
a package in the mail, you might say, &amp;quot;Where</text><text start="773.549" dur="6.06">on earth did this package come from?&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re
not actually talking about the globe, the</text><text start="779.609" dur="6.14">world, the earth. You&amp;#39;re just saying, &amp;quot;I have
absolutely no idea where this package came</text><text start="785.749" dur="5.49">from. Where on earth did this come from?&amp;quot;
This is a really fun expression. It&amp;#39;s a casual</text><text start="791.239" dur="4.931">expression, but it&amp;#39;s a fun way to show shock.
&amp;quot;Where on earth did you hear that?&amp;quot; All right,</text><text start="796.17" dur="2.289">let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you can see how
it was used.</text><text start="798.459" dur="2.43">Dan:
Me and my siblings, we all just made fun of</text><text start="800.889" dur="4.66">her. We were like, &amp;quot;Mom, you just made that
up. Where on earth did you hear that?&amp;quot; But</text><text start="805.549" dur="1.66">really it&amp;#39;s actually true.
Dan:</text><text start="807.209" dur="3.761">Me and my siblings, we all just made fun of
her. We were like, &amp;quot;Mom, you just made that</text><text start="810.97" dur="4.029">up. Where on earth did you hear that?&amp;quot; But
really it&amp;#39;s actually true.</text><text start="814.999" dur="5.77">Vanessa:
Number 11: That&amp;#39;s it. This means the end.</text><text start="820.769" dur="5.13">In our conversation, Dan and I were talking
about the amazing bird, the albatross, but</text><text start="825.899" dur="7.05">when you are a small animal in the wild, in
nature, your life is quite fragile and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="832.949" dur="8.06">the same for the albatross. &amp;quot;When the albatross
first learns to fly, if he fails, that&amp;#39;s it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="841.009" dur="5.89">That means that some other animal will probably
come and eat him, and his life will be over.</text><text start="846.899" dur="6.02">So we could say, &amp;quot;If he fails, that&amp;#39;s it.&amp;quot;
Well, we can use this in a less serious situation.</text><text start="852.919" dur="3.32">Maybe if you&amp;#39;re having a business meeting,
the person who&amp;#39;s leading the meeting might</text><text start="856.239" dur="6.2">say, &amp;quot;All right, that&amp;#39;s it. See you next week.&amp;quot;
That&amp;#39;s it. It&amp;#39;s just an informal way to say,</text><text start="862.439" dur="5.08">&amp;quot;The end.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;All right, that&amp;#39;s it. I&amp;#39;ll talk
to you later. Bye.&amp;quot; But not really. We have</text><text start="867.519" dur="4.201">more expressions to go. Okay, let&amp;#39;s watch
the clips that you can see how this was used.</text><text start="871.72" dur="2.119">Vanessa:
So sharks gather there.</text><text start="873.839" dur="1.22">Dan:
They wait for the babies.</text><text start="875.059" dur="2.2">Vanessa:
And as the babies are learning to fly, if</text><text start="877.259" dur="3.661">they fail on their first try, that&amp;#39;s it.
Vanessa:</text><text start="880.92" dur="2.039">So sharks gather there.
Dan:</text><text start="882.959" dur="1.161">They wait for the babies.
Vanessa:</text><text start="884.12" dur="5.11">And as the babies are learning to fly, if
they fail on their first try, that&amp;#39;s it.</text><text start="889.23" dur="4.399">Vanessa:
Number 12: Up to. We&amp;#39;re not really talking</text><text start="893.629" dur="6.69">about down and up. Instead, we&amp;#39;re talking
about a maximum of something. So we were talking</text><text start="900.319" dur="5.95">about the bird, the albatross again, and we
said &amp;quot;They can stay in the air up to 10,000</text><text start="906.269" dur="7.67">miles.&amp;quot; Which is absolutely crazy. This is
so long. So this is the maximum amount of</text><text start="913.939" dur="5.82">length that they can stay in the air. &amp;quot;Up
to 10,000 miles.&amp;quot; Or we could talk about your</text><text start="919.759" dur="7.31">car if you love to drive fast. I don&amp;#39;t really,
but maybe you do and you&amp;#39;re looking for some</text><text start="927.069" dur="5.221">kind of sports car that can go really fast.
You go to the store and you&amp;#39;re going to buy</text><text start="932.29" dur="7.89">a new car, and the salesman says, &amp;quot;This car
can drive up to 250 miles per hour.&amp;quot; Wow.</text><text start="940.18" dur="6.199">You can drive so fast. So he&amp;#39;s trying to sell
you on the maximum that that car can drive.</text><text start="946.379" dur="5.52">&amp;quot;It can drive up to 250 miles per hour.&amp;quot; All
right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you can</text><text start="951.899" dur="2.28">see how this expression was used.
Dan:</text><text start="954.179" dur="5.58">Once they actually get in the air, an albatross
can stay in the air for up to 10,000 miles.</text><text start="959.759" dur="1.361">Vanessa:
That&amp;#39;s a lot.</text><text start="961.12" dur="1.99">Dan:
Which is a lot of kilometers.</text><text start="963.11" dur="3.279">Dan:
Once they actually get in the air, an albatross</text><text start="966.389" dur="3.09">can stay in the air for up to 10,000 miles.
Vanessa:</text><text start="969.479" dur="1.491">That&amp;#39;s a a lot.
Dan:</text><text start="970.97" dur="2.079">Which is a lot of kilometers.
Vanessa:</text><text start="973.049" dur="9.98">Number 13: Some may argue that... This is
a polite, indirect way to show your opinion.</text><text start="983.029" dur="5.68">Dan said, &amp;quot;Some may argue that the stuffing
is better than the turkey.&amp;quot; We were talking</text><text start="988.709" dur="5.52">about different types of food that you eat
at Thanksgiving, and he said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s me.</text><text start="994.229" dur="6.42">I agree that the stuffing is better than the
turkey.&amp;quot; But he didn&amp;#39;t say, &amp;quot;I think this,&amp;quot;</text><text start="1000.649" dur="7.141">right away. Instead he used this indirect
statement. &amp;quot;Some may argue that...&amp;quot; It is</text><text start="1007.79" dur="4.919">quite indirect. You might also say, &amp;quot;Some
may argue that Vanessa&amp;#39;s lessons are the best</text><text start="1012.709" dur="6.57">in the world.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re not saying, &amp;quot;I think
this.&amp;quot; Instead, you&amp;#39;re using an indirect expression</text><text start="1019.279" dur="6.73">to say, &amp;quot;Some people may argue it&amp;#39;s possible.&amp;quot;
They may argue and say, &amp;quot;Yeah, Vanessa&amp;#39;s are</text><text start="1026.009" dur="4.29">the best in the world.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No, they&amp;#39;re not.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Yes they are.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No, they&amp;#39;re not.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Yes, they</text><text start="1030.299" dur="4.88">are.&amp;quot; Okay. Some may argue that Vanessa&amp;#39;s
lessons are the best. Well, I hope you enjoyed</text><text start="1035.179" dur="3.89">this one at least. All right. Let&amp;#39;s watch
the clips that you can see how it was used.</text><text start="1039.069" dur="3.681">Vanessa:
Inside the turkey, usually you cook some seasonings,</text><text start="1042.75" dur="4.36">and lemons, and breads and all different types
of things inside the turkey.</text><text start="1047.11" dur="3.1">Dan:
Some may argue that the stuffing is better</text><text start="1050.21" dur="2.25">than the turkey.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1052.46" dur="6.41">Inside the turkey, usually you cook some seasonings,
and lemons, and breads, and all different</text><text start="1058.87" dur="1">types of things inside the turkey.

Number 14: To find that. Hmm. This is a somewhat</text><text start="1070.95" dur="7.76">formal opinion. If you say that, &amp;quot;I find that
playing a sport helps me to relax.&amp;quot; You&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1078.71" dur="6.76">not saying, &amp;quot;Playing a sport helps me to relax.&amp;quot;
Instead, you&amp;#39;re adding an extra statement</text><text start="1085.47" dur="8.199">that makes it a little bit more formal. &amp;quot;I
find that... In my research, I find that,&amp;quot;</text><text start="1093.669" dur="7.021">and this way you&amp;#39;re not being so direct. &amp;quot;I
find that playing a sport helps me to relax.</text><text start="1100.69" dur="6.641">Maybe you will find the same thing too or
maybe not.&amp;quot; You could also say, &amp;quot;I found that</text><text start="1107.331" dur="6.249">after three months of the English classes
in my city, they weren&amp;#39;t really helping me</text><text start="1113.58" dur="5.479">that much.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I found that they weren&amp;#39;t really
helping me.&amp;quot; This is kind of like you&amp;#39;re doing</text><text start="1119.059" dur="5.271">research. &amp;quot;I found in my research,&amp;quot; but it
could just be your daily experience that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1124.33" dur="5.459">really your research. &amp;quot;I find that playing
a sport helps me relax.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I found that the</text><text start="1129.789" dur="3.431">classes didn&amp;#39;t really help me that much.&amp;quot;
All right. Let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you</text><text start="1133.22" dur="1.449">can see how this was used.
Dan:</text><text start="1134.669" dur="6.59">I don&amp;#39;t know if this would work for everyone,
but I find that playing a sport or doing something</text><text start="1141.259" dur="5.75">active that requires some concentration really
helps me not be stressed.</text><text start="1147.009" dur="2.5">Dan:

active that requires some concentration really</text><text start="1157.23" dur="2.5">helps me not be stressed.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1159.73" dur="6.5">Number 15: To not handle something. Or we
could use this in a positive way to handle</text><text start="1166.23" dur="5.26">something, but it&amp;#39;s most often used in the
negative and that means you cannot manage</text><text start="1171.49" dur="4.799">something. You cannot deal with something.
&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t handle this.&amp;quot; In the conversation</text><text start="1176.289" dur="7.441">with Dan I said, &amp;quot;My body can&amp;#39;t handle the
stress.&amp;quot; This means that my body is not capable</text><text start="1183.73" dur="6.35">of managing the stress. It can&amp;#39;t deal with
the stress. Or if you have two small children,</text><text start="1190.08" dur="8.78">you might say, &amp;quot;Having a newborn and a toddler
is hard to handle. This is difficult to handle.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1198.86" dur="6.32">Usually we use this in a negative situation.
It&amp;#39;s hard to handle. I can&amp;#39;t handle it. It&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1205.18" dur="5.449">not easy to handle. These types of negative
situations when there&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="1210.629" dur="4.101">difficult to deal with or to manage. All right,
let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you can see how</text><text start="1214.73" dur="1.549">it was used.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1216.279" dur="6.65">If I feel stressed or anxious, a lot of that&amp;#39;s
because my body can&amp;#39;t handle what&amp;#39;s happening</text><text start="1222.929" dur="3.401">in daily life because I haven&amp;#39;t been treating
myself well.</text><text start="1226.33" dur="3.52">Vanessa:
If I feel stressed or anxious, a lot of that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1229.85" dur="5.87">because my body can&amp;#39;t handle what&amp;#39;s happening
in daily life because I haven&amp;#39;t been treating</text><text start="1235.72" dur="1.38">myself well.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1237.1" dur="6.059">Number 16: To get into something. This is
a great phrasal verb and that means to start</text><text start="1243.159" dur="6.341">your interest in something. We often use this
in small talk to say, &amp;quot;Oh, when did you get</text><text start="1249.5" dur="5.75">into soccer? When did you get into the Beatles?
When did you get into some activity?&amp;quot; And</text><text start="1255.25" dur="6.621">it means when did your interest begin in this
activity? In the conversation with Dan, he</text><text start="1261.871" dur="6.699">said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy to get into soccer.&amp;quot; That
means there&amp;#39;s not much of a barrier for starting</text><text start="1268.57" dur="5.989">your interest in soccer. You can just put
on some shoes, have a ball, and kick it with</text><text start="1274.559" dur="6.831">some friends. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy to get into soccer.&amp;quot;
Or you might ask, &amp;quot;When did you get into rock</text><text start="1281.39" dur="6.6">music? When did you get into playing the guitar?&amp;quot;
This is talking about starting your interest.</text><text start="1287.99" dur="5.519">Keep this in mind because for the next expression
we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about something</text><text start="1293.509" dur="4.241">that&amp;#39;s similar, but a little bit different.
All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the original clips</text><text start="1297.75" dur="3.5">that you can see how to get into was used.
Dan:</text><text start="1301.25" dur="3.69">It&amp;#39;s interesting. Many, many children play
soccer in America.</text><text start="1304.94" dur="1">Vanessa:
Yeah. I think-</text><text start="1305.94" dur="1">Dan:
It&amp;#39;s very common.</text><text start="1306.94" dur="1.26">Vanessa:
... it&amp;#39;s very easy to get into because you</text><text start="1308.2" dur="2.08">just are running and kicking a ball.
Dan:</text><text start="1310.28" dur="1">Sure.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1311.28" dur="1.81">There&amp;#39;s no equipment or specialized movements.
Dan:</text><text start="1313.09" dur="4.299">It&amp;#39;s interesting. Many, many children play
soccer in America.</text><text start="1317.389" dur="1">Vanessa:
Yeah. I think-</text><text start="1318.389" dur="1">Dan:
It&amp;#39;s very common.</text><text start="1319.389" dur="1.76">Vanessa:
... it&amp;#39;s easy to get into because you just</text><text start="1321.149" dur="4.211">are running and kicking a ball. There&amp;#39;s no
equipment or specialized movements.</text><text start="1325.36" dur="4.98">Vanessa:
Number 17 is to take up something. This is</text><text start="1330.34" dur="5.799">another phrasal verb and it&amp;#39;s talking about
starting an activity, but it&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text><text start="1336.139" dur="6.951">talking about your interest. It&amp;#39;s talking
about really starting that activity so you</text><text start="1343.09" dur="7.709">could say, &amp;quot;My brother convinced me to take
up hockey.&amp;quot; Dan was talking about starting</text><text start="1350.799" dur="6.031">the activity of hockey. His brother said,
&amp;quot;You should play hockey.&amp;quot; His brother convinced</text><text start="1356.83" dur="6.29">him to start hockey or to take up hockey.
You might also say, &amp;quot;I thought about taking</text><text start="1363.12" dur="5.35">up knitting, but I&amp;#39;m too busy.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I thought
about taking up some activity.&amp;quot; That means</text><text start="1368.47" dur="2.919">starting the activity.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1371.389" dur="5.951">If we get into an activity like the phrasal
verb we just talked about a moment ago, this</text><text start="1377.34" dur="6.939">is talking about our interest. When did your
interest begin? Maybe you got into knitting</text><text start="1384.279" dur="6.061">when you were a little kid, but you didn&amp;#39;t
start actually knitting. This is just your</text><text start="1390.34" dur="5.99">interest beginning, but then &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to
take up knitting&amp;quot; means that you&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="1396.33" dur="5.62">to actually start that activity. These two
phrasal verbs are linked together, but they</text><text start="1401.95" dur="3.809">do have slightly different meetings. So let&amp;#39;s
take a look at the clips that you can see</text><text start="1405.759" dur="1.39">how it was used.
Dan:</text><text start="1407.149" dur="2.671">And then I did figure skating, where we were
doing spinning and stuff.</text><text start="1409.82" dur="1.63">Vanessa:
I did figure skating too.</text><text start="1411.45" dur="2.699">Dan:
Yes. And then my brother convinced me to take</text><text start="1414.149" dur="1.91">up a more manly sport: hockey.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1416.059" dur="3.73">Oh, that&amp;#39;s a shame. You probably would have
been really good at figure skating.</text><text start="1419.789" dur="2.38">Dan:
And then I did figure skating, where we were</text><text start="1422.169" dur="1">doing spinning and stuff.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1423.169" dur="2.051">I did figure skating too.
Dan:</text><text start="1425.22" dur="3.839">Yes. And then my brother convinced me to take
up a more manly sport: hockey.</text><text start="1429.059" dur="2.11">Vanessa:
Oh, that&amp;#39;s a shame. You probably would have</text><text start="1431.169" dur="2.421">been really good at figure skating.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1433.59" dur="6.4">Number 18 is &amp;quot;Up to you.&amp;quot; Notice that we just
talked about the expression &amp;quot;up to.&amp;quot; The car</text><text start="1439.99" dur="5.439">drives up to 250 miles per hour, but this
expression is different because we&amp;#39;re adding</text><text start="1445.429" dur="2.921">a pronoun. It&amp;#39;s up to you.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1448.35" dur="8.829">Hmm. What does this mean? It means that the
responsibility is yours. When you have a team</text><text start="1457.179" dur="6.031">activity, when you&amp;#39;re playing a sport with
a team, it&amp;#39;s not only your responsibility,</text><text start="1463.21" dur="7.209">it is the responsibility of the whole team
to win. So that&amp;#39;s how Dan used it in the conversation.</text><text start="1470.419" dur="5.901">He said, &amp;quot;Team sports are not all up to you.
That&amp;#39;s why he likes them because he likes</text><text start="1476.32" dur="6.069">that shared responsibility, but a lot of things
are just your responsibility. If you&amp;#39;re about</text><text start="1482.389" dur="5.841">to go to have a dinner for your birthday with
a bunch of friends, your friends might say,</text><text start="1488.23" dur="5.73">&amp;quot;Well, it&amp;#39;s up to you. It&amp;#39;s your birthday.
Where do you want to go? It&amp;#39;s up to you.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1493.96" dur="1.569">Vanessa:
This is a really common expression that I</text><text start="1495.529" dur="5.201">use a lot in daily life. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know where
I want to go. It&amp;#39;s up to you. You choose.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1500.73" dur="5.54">But make sure you add that pronoun at the
end. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s up to you.&amp;quot; Or if you&amp;#39;re in a work</text><text start="1506.27" dur="5.56">situation and your coworker says, &amp;quot;Should
we change this? Should we do this?&amp;quot; You might</text><text start="1511.83" dur="6.919">say, &amp;quot;Eh, it&amp;#39;s up to the boss. I can&amp;#39;t make
that decision. I don&amp;#39;t have that responsibility.</text><text start="1518.749" dur="4.911">It&amp;#39;s up to the boss.&amp;quot; Or, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s up to him.
I can&amp;#39;t make that decision.&amp;quot; So there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="1523.66" dur="4.18">lot of different ways that you can use this,
but make sure that there&amp;#39;s a person directly</text><text start="1527.84" dur="5.12">after &amp;quot;up to.&amp;quot; Up to you, up to him, up to
the boss. All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips</text><text start="1532.96" dur="1.76">that you can see how it was used.
Dan:</text><text start="1534.72" dur="5.78">If I were swimming and racing, I&amp;#39;d be so scared.
But when I play a sport like basketball, you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1540.5" dur="5.7">on a team and so you&amp;#39;re kind of depending
on each other more. It&amp;#39;s not all up to you.</text><text start="1546.2" dur="1">Vanessa:
Yeah.</text><text start="1547.2" dur="2.89">Dan:
If I were swimming and racing, I&amp;#39;d be so scared.</text><text start="1550.09" dur="6.23">But when I play a sport like basketball, you&amp;#39;re
on a team and so you&amp;#39;re kind of depending</text><text start="1556.32" dur="2.839">on each other more. It&amp;#39;s not all up to you.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1559.159" dur="8.251">Number 19: Peace of mind. Make sure that you
spell the word peace correctly. It&amp;#39;s the opposite</text><text start="1567.41" dur="8.16">of war. Peace. Peace of mind. It means that
you&amp;#39;re doing something for safety and security,</text><text start="1575.57" dur="7.12">for peace of mind. In the conversation with
Dan, he said he wants to get a security system</text><text start="1582.69" dur="5.099">for peace of mind. Our neighborhood&amp;#39;s not
really that dangerous. It&amp;#39;s not dangerous</text><text start="1587.789" dur="7.081">at all, but he wants it so that his mind will
feel peace. He wants it for peace of mind.</text><text start="1594.87" dur="6.919">Or if your daughter is out late and it&amp;#39;s 10
o&amp;#39;clock, you imagine that she&amp;#39;s probably fine,</text><text start="1601.789" dur="5.422">but you want to call for peace of mind. So
you might call and say, &amp;quot;Hey, I just wanted</text><text start="1607.211" dur="5.788">to make sure you&amp;#39;re okay. I was just giving
you a call for peace of mind.&amp;quot; Great. It shows</text><text start="1612.999" dur="6.621">that by calling her, you&amp;#39;re feeling safe and
secure. You want to feel peace so you do that</text><text start="1619.62" dur="3.36">activity. All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips
that you can see how this was used.</text><text start="1622.98" dur="2.59">Dan:
I&amp;#39;d like to get some cameras and something</text><text start="1625.57" dur="4.739">I could check on the house and make sure everything&amp;#39;s
okay, and just for peace of mind, mostly.</text><text start="1630.309" dur="2.87">Dan:
I&amp;#39;d like to get some cameras and something</text><text start="1633.179" dur="4.74">I could check on the house, and make sure
everything&amp;#39;s okay, and just for peace of mind,</text><text start="1637.919" dur="1">mostly.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1638.919" dur="7.12">Number 20: Outright. This means completely
or immediately. I mentioned briefly in the</text><text start="1646.039" dur="7.401">conversation with Dan that we paid for our
car outright. This means the day that we purchased</text><text start="1653.44" dur="8.329">our car, we gave them cash, we wrote a check,
we paid in full for the car. We paid completely</text><text start="1661.769" dur="5.52">and immediately for the car. That&amp;#39;s a common
expression. When you pay for something without</text><text start="1667.289" dur="4.171">a bank loan, you might say, &amp;quot;We paid for it
outright.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1671.46" dur="3.459">Vanessa:
We can also use outright in other situations</text><text start="1674.919" dur="8.151">to talk about completely, immediately, especially
when someone dismisses your idea. Let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="1683.07" dur="6.54">that you tell your husband, &amp;quot;For our next
vacation, let&amp;#39;s go skiing in the Alps.&amp;quot; If</text><text start="1689.61" dur="6.73">he says, &amp;quot;No, let&amp;#39;s not do that,&amp;quot; Immediately.
Oh, that&amp;#39;s kind of disappointing. But you</text><text start="1696.34" dur="8.41">could say, &amp;quot;He outright dismissed my idea.&amp;quot;
The word outright is right before that verb,</text><text start="1704.75" dur="5.879">it&amp;#39;s an adverb describing dismissed. How did
he dismiss your idea? He outright immediately,</text><text start="1710.629" dur="6.741">completely dismissed your idea. He outright
dismissed my idea or he dismissed my idea</text><text start="1717.37" dur="5.99">outright. Sorry. I guess you&amp;#39;ll have to do
something else for your vacation or else you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="1723.36" dur="4.36">have to convince him that that&amp;#39;s a great idea.
Okay, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you can see</text><text start="1727.72" dur="2.02">how to use &amp;quot;Outright.&amp;quot;
Dan:</text><text start="1729.74" dur="3.64">We had just bought the car, and it was pretty
expensive, and we didn&amp;#39;t really have that</text><text start="1733.38" dur="3.23">much money, and I was like, &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t afford
to get the keys too.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1736.61" dur="2.88">Vanessa:
Sure because we decided to pay for the car</text><text start="1739.49" dur="1">outright.
Dan:</text><text start="1740.49" dur="3.62">But it&amp;#39;s definitely doable this very simple
fix in your life.</text><text start="1744.11" dur="2.899">Dan:
We had just bought the car and it was pretty</text><text start="1747.009" dur="3.41">expensive, and we didn&amp;#39;t really have that
much money, and I was like, &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t afford</text><text start="1750.419" dur="1.651">to get the keys too.&amp;quot;
Vanessa:</text><text start="1752.07" dur="2.609">Sure because we decided to pay for the car
outright.</text><text start="1754.679" dur="3.651">Dan:
But it&amp;#39;s definitely doable, this very simple</text><text start="1758.33" dur="1.429">fix in your life.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1759.759" dur="9.15">Number 21: To check all the boxes. This is
a figurative checklist. It&amp;#39;s not a real checklist,</text><text start="1768.909" dur="5.15">but you can still have that image in your
head that there is a box and you are checking</text><text start="1774.059" dur="6.59">each of the boxes. So in the conversation
with Dan, he was talking about a regretful</text><text start="1780.649" dur="8.01">purchase that made of some headphones, and
he said, &amp;quot;It checked all the boxes of a regretful</text><text start="1788.659" dur="6.181">purchase.&amp;quot; There were a lot of reasons why
it was a regretful purchase. It was expensive.</text><text start="1794.84" dur="5.75">I didn&amp;#39;t want him to make that purchase, and
then they weren&amp;#39;t comfortable, and our cat</text><text start="1800.59" dur="5.87">bit them and they broke. So a lot of bad things
happening for that purchase. So he could say,</text><text start="1806.46" dur="4.719">&amp;quot;It checked all the boxes have a regretful
purchase.&amp;quot; We can imagine that there is a</text><text start="1811.179" dur="6.07">checklist. Regretful purchase checklist. And
his purchase of those headphones checked all</text><text start="1817.249" dur="4.101">the boxes. It was definitely a regretful purchase.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1821.35" dur="8.53">Or you could say, &amp;quot;I married her because she
checked all the boxes. She was kind, smart,</text><text start="1829.88" dur="6.45">beautiful, intelligent. Wow. She checked all
the boxes.&amp;quot; This isn&amp;#39;t a real checklist, but</text><text start="1836.33" dur="4.44">this is a figurative checklist. &amp;quot;Yeah, she
checked all the boxes and we&amp;#39;re a great match.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1840.77" dur="3.859">Excellent. All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips
so you can see how this was used.</text><text start="1844.629" dur="2.781">Dan:
Regretful purchases. Well, the first one I</text><text start="1847.41" dur="5.44">can think of kind of checks all of the boxes
as something you regret because in the first</text><text start="1852.85" dur="2.829">place, you didn&amp;#39;t want me to buy this.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1855.679" dur="1.1">Because it was-
Dan:</text><text start="1856.779" dur="1">Expensive.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1857.779" dur="1">Headphones.
Dan:</text><text start="1858.779" dur="4.791">Regretful purchases. Well, the first one I
can think of kind of checks all of the boxes</text><text start="1863.57" dur="5.169">as something you regret because in the first
place you didn&amp;#39;t want me to buy this.</text><text start="1868.739" dur="1">Vanessa:
Because it was-</text><text start="1869.739" dur="1">Dan:
Expensive.</text><text start="1870.739" dur="1">Vanessa:
Headphones.</text><text start="1871.739" dur="3.66">Vanessa:
Number 22: Icing on the cake. I love this</text><text start="1875.399" dur="7.52">idiom and it means an additional benefit or
negative item. So in the conversation with</text><text start="1882.919" dur="7.36">Dan, when he was talking about that regretful
purchase, he said, &amp;quot;It was icing on the cake</text><text start="1890.279" dur="7.24">that our cat bit them.&amp;quot; Our cat bit his headphones,
and they broke after having them just a couple</text><text start="1897.519" dur="7.03">seconds. So there was a lot of bad things
happening, and our cat biting them was one</text><text start="1904.549" dur="4.23">additional thing. So that was icing on the
cake.</text><text start="1908.779" dur="3.28">Vanessa:
When you have a cake on the outside, it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1912.059" dur="7.61">that creamy frosting or we can call that icing,
the outside. Without icing a cake is pretty</text><text start="1919.669" dur="7.181">good, but when you have icing, oh, that&amp;#39;s
just one more thing that makes that cake great.</text><text start="1926.85" dur="5.29">But we can also use this idiom in those negative
situations. Like, &amp;quot;It was icing on the cake</text><text start="1932.14" dur="4.119">when our cat bit the headphones. One more
negative thing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1936.259" dur="3.201">Vanessa:
Or if you&amp;#39;re talking about someone&amp;#39;s personality,</text><text start="1939.46" dur="5.849">you could say, &amp;quot;Well, the teacher was great
at explaining things and his humor was icing</text><text start="1945.309" dur="5.69">on the cake.&amp;quot; A good teacher is good at explaining
things. A good teacher doesn&amp;#39;t need to be</text><text start="1950.999" dur="6.481">funny, but when a teacher is funny, that is
icing on the cake. It&amp;#39;s one additional benefit.</text><text start="1957.48" dur="5.949">&amp;quot;His humor was icing on the cake. It made
the class just a little bit more enjoyable.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1963.429" dur="4.161">All right, let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you
can see how this fun icing on the cake idiom</text><text start="1967.59" dur="1.11">was used.
Dan:</text><text start="1968.7" dur="3.06">The cat bent the cord anyways so...
Vanessa:</text><text start="1971.76" dur="4.69">And that&amp;#39;s something that we should have known.
We should have put them up somewhere. You</text><text start="1976.45" dur="4.309">could have put them somewhere else, but it
just kind of was icing on the cake.</text><text start="1980.759" dur="1">Dan:
Yeah.</text><text start="1981.759" dur="1">Vanessa:
Which means it was-</text><text start="1982.759" dur="1">Dan:
Now I can&amp;#39;t use them.</text><text start="1983.759" dur="1">Vanessa:
... one more thing.</text><text start="1984.759" dur="2.38">Dan:
The cat bit the cord anyways so...</text><text start="1987.139" dur="3.41">Vanessa:
And that&amp;#39;s something that we should have known.</text><text start="1990.549" dur="4">We should have put them up somewhere. You
could have put them somewhere else, but it</text><text start="1994.549" dur="2.311">just kind of was icing on the cake.
Dan:</text><text start="1996.86" dur="1">Yeah.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1997.86" dur="1">Which means it was-
Dan:</text><text start="1998.86" dur="1">Now I can&amp;#39;t even use them.
Vanessa:</text><text start="1999.86" dur="1">... one more thing.
Vanessa:</text><text start="2000.86" dur="8.759">Number 23 is &amp;quot;Worth it.&amp;quot; This means that the
benefits outweighed the cost. If we use this</text><text start="2009.619" dur="5.55">in a negative way, like I did in the conversation
with Dan, I said, &amp;quot;Tea at Starbucks is never</text><text start="2015.169" dur="6.671">worth it. The benefits of the tea do not outweigh
the cost. The quality&amp;#39;s not that great. The</text><text start="2021.84" dur="5.42">price is too high for the quality. It is not
worth it.&amp;quot; But of course we can use this in</text><text start="2027.26" dur="5.489">a positive way too. You might say, &amp;quot;We drove
through the rain to get to the concert, but</text><text start="2032.749" dur="5.78">it was worth it.&amp;quot; So you struggled a little
bit to get to the concert, but the benefit</text><text start="2038.529" dur="6.71">of going to the concert was worth the cost.
We&amp;#39;re not talking about the monetary cost</text><text start="2045.239" dur="5.711">here, the price of the concert. Instead, we&amp;#39;re
talking about the struggle that you went through.</text><text start="2050.95" dur="3.969">Driving through the rain. &amp;quot;We drove the rain,
but it was worth it.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2054.919" dur="2.091">Vanessa:
I hope that this lesson is a worth it. This</text><text start="2057.01" dur="4.2">is a long English lesson, but I hope that
it&amp;#39;s worth it. I hope that the benefit of</text><text start="2061.21" dur="5.219">this lesson, the things that you&amp;#39;re learning
are worth the time that you&amp;#39;re spending. All</text><text start="2066.429" dur="2.47">right. Let&amp;#39;s watch the clips that you can
see how this was used.</text><text start="2068.899" dur="3.18">Vanessa:
Well, for me, it&amp;#39;s the taste. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text><text start="2072.079" dur="7.311">the price. The price is high for tea, but
the taste is never worth it. It&amp;#39;s just mediocre</text><text start="2079.39" dur="1.88">tea. It&amp;#39;s not even that great.
Vanessa:</text><text start="2081.27" dur="6.73">Well, for me it&amp;#39;s the taste. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily
the price. The price is high for tea, but</text><text start="2088" dur="4.7">the taste is never worth it. It&amp;#39;s just mediocre
tea. It&amp;#39;s not even that great.</text><text start="2092.7" dur="5.01">Vanessa:
Number 24: To sweat something. This is not</text><text start="2097.71" dur="8.02">necessarily talking about literal sweat, but
instead this is talking about to stress about</text><text start="2105.73" dur="9.21">something and Dan said, &amp;quot;I never sweat a small
purchase.&amp;quot; If you buy something that&amp;#39;s cheap</text><text start="2114.94" dur="6.73">and then it is really not a good purchase,
he doesn&amp;#39;t feel stress about that. He doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2121.67" dur="7.84">sweat small purchases. Or you could just simply
say, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t sweat it.&amp;quot; If someone is late</text><text start="2129.51" dur="4.41">coming to your dinner party and they say,
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry I was late.&amp;quot; You could say,</text><text start="2133.92" dur="5.23">&amp;quot;Oh, don&amp;#39;t sweat it. Don&amp;#39;t worry about it.
Don&amp;#39;t feel stress about this. Don&amp;#39;t sweat</text><text start="2139.15" dur="5.14">it.&amp;quot; Okay, let&amp;#39;s see how to use this fun expression,
&amp;quot;sweat,&amp;quot; in the conversation.</text><text start="2144.29" dur="2.96">Vanessa:
$2.50 just for a bag of tea and you can buy</text><text start="2147.25" dur="2.569">a whole box of tea for the same price.
Dan:</text><text start="2149.819" dur="5.361">By the way, this is the difference between
Vanessa and I, is that I would never sweat</text><text start="2155.18" dur="1.57">a purchase like that.
Vanessa:</text><text start="2156.75" dur="4.359">$2.50 just for a bag of tea and you can buy
a whole box of tea for the same price.</text><text start="2161.109" dur="2.581">Dan:
By the way, this is the difference between</text><text start="2163.69" dur="4.369">Vanessa and I, is that I would never sweat
a purchase like that.</text><text start="2168.059" dur="5.091">Vanessa:
Number 25, our final expression is &amp;quot;Iffy.&amp;quot;</text><text start="2173.15" dur="7.31">This means questionable or uncertain. In the
conversation Dan was talking about how sometimes</text><text start="2180.46" dur="7.5">he regrets buying clothes online because it&amp;#39;s
iffy. You don&amp;#39;t know the quality of the material.</text><text start="2187.96" dur="6.42">You don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s going to fit you.
So buying clothes online can be iffy, it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2194.38" dur="7.16">uncertain. Or let&amp;#39;s say that one of your friends
gets laid off from his job he might cancel</text><text start="2201.54" dur="6.71">his Netflix account because his finances are
iffy. He doesn&amp;#39;t have a job anymore. He has</text><text start="2208.25" dur="7.41">no more income, so he should probably cancel
unnecessary purchases because his finances</text><text start="2215.66" dur="5.58">are uncertain. He doesn&amp;#39;t know when he&amp;#39;s going
to get more money. His finances are iffy.</text><text start="2221.24" dur="2">It&amp;#39;s kind of iffy.
Vanessa:</text><text start="2223.24" dur="5.75">You can even use this to talk about the weather.
&amp;quot;The weather&amp;#39;s kind of iffy today, so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2228.99" dur="5.74">go on our hike tomorrow.&amp;quot; That means that
the weather is questionable. It&amp;#39;s uncertain.</text><text start="2234.73" dur="4.99">It might rain. It might not rain. It might
snow. I don&amp;#39;t know. &amp;quot;So the weather is a little</text><text start="2239.72" dur="5.18">iffy. Let&amp;#39;s cancel or let&amp;#39;s postpone this
until another day.&amp;quot; All right, let&amp;#39;s watch</text><text start="2244.9" dur="2.429">the clips that you can see how &amp;quot;iffy&amp;quot; was
used.</text><text start="2247.329" dur="3.911">Dan:
I bought some t-shirts online, and it&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="2251.24" dur="5.46">of iffy to buy clothes online, but I always
felt like I liked the picture that was on</text><text start="2256.7" dur="2.54">them. But then the quality of the shirt wasn&amp;#39;t
very good.</text><text start="2259.24" dur="1.129">Vanessa:
Especially when it&amp;#39;s online. You can&amp;#39;t feel</text><text start="2260.369" dur="1">it.
Dan:</text><text start="2261.369" dur="1">It didn&amp;#39;t fit that well.

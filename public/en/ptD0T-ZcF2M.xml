<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="5.864" dur="0.863">I was lucky,</text><text start="7.087" dur="1.784">I found what I love to do,</text><text start="8.917" dur="1.074">early in life.</text><text start="10.231" dur="3.028">Woz and I started Apple in my
parents garage when I was 20.</text><text start="13.764" dur="0.829">We worked hard</text><text start="14.801" dur="3.104">and in 10 years Apple had grown
from just the two of us in garage,</text><text start="18.216" dur="3.187">into a 2 billion dollar company
with over 4000 employees.</text><text start="22.008" dur="2.208">We just released our finest creation,</text><text start="24.288" dur="1.437">the Macintosh, a year earlier</text><text start="25.825" dur="1.27">and I just turned 30.</text><text start="28.307" dur="1.029">And then I got fired.</text><text start="32.008" dur="2.496">How can you get fired from
a company you started?</text><text start="36.876" dur="2.86">What had been the focus of my
entire adult life was gone</text><text start="39.979" dur="1.182">and it was devastating.</text><text start="42.1" dur="1.804">I really didn&amp;#39;t know what
to do for few months,</text><text start="44.783" dur="3.099">I felt that I had let the previous
generation of entrepreneurs down.</text><text start="51.168" dur="3.336">I was a very public failure and I even
thought about running away from the valley.</text><text start="55.264" dur="2.105">But something slowly began to dawn on me.</text><text start="58.316" dur="1.787">I still loved what I did.</text><text start="63.616" dur="1.848">We are gonna make it or break it,</text><text start="65.502" dur="2.039">based on whether we
can provide products,</text><text start="67.765" dur="2.276">to higher education and services</text><text start="70.213" dur="1.967">and relationships to higher education,</text><text start="72.52" dur="1.791">that no one else provides.</text><text start="74.904" dur="3.807">And I think we got to spend a 100
percent of our time thinking about that</text><text start="79.145" dur="3.15">and if we can&amp;#39;t do that
then we ought to go broke.</text><text start="85.024" dur="1.627">And so I decided to start over,</text><text start="87.881" dur="1.267">I didn&amp;#39;t see it then,</text><text start="89.308" dur="1.693">but it turned out that
getting fired from Apple</text><text start="91.078" dur="1.923">was the best thing that
could ever happen to me.</text><text start="93.936" dur="2.072">The heaviness of being successful</text><text start="96.012" dur="1.124">was replaced by the lightness,</text><text start="97.48" dur="1.407">of being a beginner again,</text><text start="99.035" dur="1.468">less sure about everything.</text><text start="101.089" dur="2.587">It freed me to enter one of the most 
creative periods of my life.</text><text start="104.552" dur="2.332">During the next five years, I started
a company named Next,</text><text start="107.474" dur="1.347">another company named Pixar.</text><text start="109.145" dur="2.539">And fell in love with an amazing
woman who would become my wife.</text><text start="112.191" dur="3.41">I am pretty sure none of this would have
happened if I hadn&amp;#39;t been fired from Apple.</text><text start="116.168" dur="1.482">It was awful tasting medicine,</text><text start="117.964" dur="1.492">but I guess the patient needed it.</text><text start="119.736" dur="2.368">Sometimes life is gonna hit
you in the head with a brick.</text><text start="122.708" dur="0.938">Don&amp;#39;t lose faith.</text><text start="124.608" dur="3.754">I am convinced that the only thing that
kept me going was I loved what I did.</text><text start="128.704" dur="2.153">You have got to find what you love</text><text start="130.883" dur="2.611">and that is as true for work
as it is for your lovers.</text><text start="134.528" dur="2.084">Your work is gonna fill
a large part of your life</text><text start="136.96" dur="4.12">and the only way to be truly satisfied is
to do what you believe is great work.</text><text start="141.424" dur="3.496">And the only way to do great
work is to love what you do.</text><text start="145.422" dur="3.881">If you haven&amp;#39;t found it yet
keep looking and don&amp;#39;t settle.</text><text start="150.188" dur="2.373">So keep looking do not settle.</text></transcript>

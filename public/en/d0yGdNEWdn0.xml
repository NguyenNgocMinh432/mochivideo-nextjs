Reviewer: Allam Zedan</text><text start="10.159" dur="2.563">The people in the back,
can you hear me clearly?</text><text start="13.03" dur="1.094">OK, good.</text><text start="15.571" dur="3.925">Have you ever held a question in mind</text><text start="19.496" dur="4.895">for so long that it becomes
part of how you think?</text><text start="25.237" dur="2.927">Maybe even part of who you are
as a person?</text><text start="28.795" dur="4.081">Well I&amp;#39;ve had a question in my mind 
for many, many years</text><text start="32.876" dur="4.348">and that is: 
How can you speed up learning?</text><text start="38.085" dur="2.563">Now, this is an interesting question</text><text start="40.648" dur="1.711">because if you speed up learning,</text><text start="42.359" dur="1.641">you can spend less time at school.</text><text start="44.97" dur="2.129">And if you learn really fast,</text><text start="47.119" dur="2.759">you probably 
wouldn&amp;#39;t have to go to school at all.</text><text start="50.818" dur="3.059">Now, when I was young, 
school was sort of OK but...</text><text start="54.983" dur="3.306">I found quite often that school 
got in the way of learning</text><text start="58.859" dur="2.926">so I had this question in mind: 
How do you learn faster?</text><text start="62.523" dur="3.298">And this began when I was 
very, very young,</text><text start="65.821" dur="1.676">when I was 11 years old,</text><text start="67.497" dur="4.385">I wrote a letter to researchers in the 
Soviet Union, asking about hypnopaedia,</text><text start="71.882" dur="2.04">this is sleep-learning,</text><text start="73.922" dur="2.97">where you get a tape recorder, 
you put it beside your bed</text><text start="76.892" dur="2.114">and it turns on 
in the middle of the night</text><text start="79.006" dur="1.433">when you&amp;#39;re sleeping,</text><text start="80.439" dur="2.213">and you&amp;#39;re supposed to be 
learning from this.</text><text start="82.688" dur="2.78">A good idea, 
unfortunately it doesn&amp;#39;t work.</text><text start="85.468" dur="4.315">But, hypnopaedia did open the doors 
to research in other areas</text><text start="89.783" dur="2.3">and we&amp;#39;ve had 
incredible discoveries about </text><text start="92.083" dur="2.85">learning that began 
with that first question.</text><text start="96.123" dur="3.17">I went on from there to become 
passionate about psychology</text><text start="99.293" dur="3.856">and I have been involved in psychology
in many different ways</text><text start="103.149" dur="2.819">for the rest of my life 
up until this point.</text><text start="105.968" dur="3.647">In 1981, I took myself to China</text><text start="109.985" dur="6.059">and I decided that I was going to be 
native level in Chinese inside two years.</text><text start="116.674" dur="4.856">Now, you need to understand that 
in 1981, everybody thought</text><text start="121.53" dur="2.482">Chinese was really, really difficult</text><text start="124.012" dur="2.482">and that a Westerner 
could study for 10 years or more</text><text start="126.494" dur="2.483">and never really get very good at it.</text><text start="128.977" dur="2.105">And I also went in with a different idea</text><text start="131.082" dur="2.551">which was: taking all of the conclusions</text><text start="133.633" dur="2.551">from psychological research 
up to that point</text><text start="136.184" dur="2.551">and applying them 
to the learning process.</text><text start="139.751" dur="4.308">What was really cool was that in six 
months I was fluent in Mandarin Chinese</text><text start="144.059" dur="2.962">and it took a little bit longer 
to get up to native.</text><text start="148.267" dur="5.228">But I looked around and I saw all of 
these people from different countries</text><text start="153.495" dur="2.182">struggling terribly with Chinese,</text><text start="155.677" dur="4.661">I saw Chinese people struggling terribly 
to learn English and other languages,</text><text start="160.338" dur="4.595">and so my question got refined down to:</text><text start="164.933" dur="2.294">How can you help a normal adult</text><text start="167.537" dur="3.164">learn a new language 
quickly, easily and effectively?</text><text start="171.261" dur="3.166">Now this is a really, really important 
question in today&amp;#39;s world.</text><text start="174.427" dur="2.191">We have massive challenges 
with environment,</text><text start="176.618" dur="3.058">we have massive challenges 
with social dislocation,</text><text start="179.676" dur="2.399">with wars, all sorts of things going on</text><text start="182.075" dur="2.554">and if we can&amp;#39;t communicate,</text><text start="184.639" dur="2.924">we&amp;#39;re really going to have difficulty 
solving these problems.</text><text start="187.563" dur="2.744">So we need to be able to speak 
each other&amp;#39;s languages,</text><text start="190.307" dur="1.941">this is really, really important.</text><text start="192.941" dur="2.49">The question then is: How do you do that?</text><text start="196.002" dur="2.887">Well, it&amp;#39;s actually really easy.</text><text start="198.889" dur="2.887">You look around for people 
who can already do it,</text><text start="201.776" dur="2.887">you look for situations 
where it&amp;#39;s already working</text><text start="204.663" dur="2.849">and then you identify the principles
and apply them.</text><text start="207.512" dur="3.064">It&amp;#39;s called modelling and I&amp;#39;ve been 
looking at language learning</text><text start="210.576" dur="4.254">and modelling language learning 
for about 15 to 20 years now.</text><text start="215.568" dur="2.714">And my conclusion, 
my observation from this is</text><text start="218.282" dur="4.29">that any adult can learn a second 
language to fluency inside six months.</text><text start="223.926" dur="5.149">Now when I say this, most people 
think I&amp;#39;m crazy, this is not possible.</text><text start="229.66" dur="4.147">So let me remind everybody of 
the history of human progress,</text><text start="233.807" dur="2.491">it&amp;#39;s all about expanding our limits.</text><text start="237.176" dur="5.744">In 1950, everybody believed that running 
one mile in four minutes was impossible,</text><text start="243.628" dur="2.98">and then Roger Bannister did it in 1956</text><text start="246.608" dur="2.41">and from there 
it&amp;#39;s got shorter and shorter.</text><text start="249.038" dur="3.04">100 years ago everybody believed that 
heavy stuff doesn&amp;#39;t fly.</text><text start="252.748" dur="2.549">Except it does and we all know this.</text><text start="256.481" dur="1.589">How does heavy stuff fly?</text><text start="258.07" dur="4.199">We reorganise the material 
using principles that we have learned</text><text start="262.269" dur="3.118">from observing nature, birds in this case.</text><text start="266.111" dur="2.985">And today we&amp;#39;ve gone even further...</text><text start="270.942" dur="3.157">We&amp;#39;ve gone even further, 
so you can fly a car.</text><text start="274.622" dur="2.799">You can buy one of these 
for a couple 100.000 US dollars.</text><text start="277.96" dur="1.925">We now have cars in the world that fly.</text><text start="279.885" dur="3.42">And there&amp;#39;s a different way to fly 
which we&amp;#39;ve learned from squirrels.</text><text start="283.553" dur="2.796">So all you need to do is copy 
what a flying squirrel does,</text><text start="286.349" dur="3.691">build a suit called a wing suit and 
off you go, you can fly like a squirrel.</text><text start="290.902" dur="3.647">Now most people, a lot of people, 
I wouldn&amp;#39;t say everybody</text><text start="294.549" dur="2.274">but a lot of people think they can&amp;#39;t draw.</text><text start="297.377" dur="4.203">However there are some key principles, 
five principles, that you can apply</text><text start="301.58" dur="3.588">to learning to draw and you can 
actually learn to draw in five days.</text><text start="305.168" dur="5.38">So, if you draw like this, you learn 
these principles for five days</text><text start="310.548" dur="4.064">and apply them and after five days 
you can draw something like this.</text><text start="315.259" dur="2.883">Now I know this is true because 
that was my first drawing</text><text start="318.142" dur="4.001">and after five days of applying these 
principles that was what I was able to do.</text><text start="322.143" dur="1.787">And I looked at this and I went:</text><text start="323.93" dur="3.641">&amp;quot;Wow, so that&amp;#39;s how I look like 
when I&amp;#39;m concentrating so intensely</text><text start="327.571" dur="2.12">that my brain is exploding.&amp;quot;</text><text start="331.199" dur="3.153">So, anybody can learn to draw in five days</text><text start="335.921" dur="2.046">and in the same way, with the same logic,</text><text start="337.967" dur="3.881">anybody can learn a second language
in six months.</text><text start="342.602" dur="3.091">How? There are five principles
and seven actions.</text><text start="346.309" dur="2.583">There may be a few more 
but these are absolutely core.</text><text start="349.539" dur="3.625">And before I get into those 
I just want to talk about two myths,</text><text start="353.164" dur="1.826">I want to dispel two myths.</text><text start="354.99" dur="1.977">The first is that you need talent.</text><text start="356.967" dur="1.434">Let me tell you about Zoe.</text><text start="358.955" dur="3.983">Zoe came from Australia, went to Holland, 
was trying to learn Dutch,</text><text start="363.506" dur="3.252">struggling extremely, extremely... 
a great deal</text><text start="366.758" dur="2.578">and finally people were saying: 
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re completely useless,&amp;quot;</text><text start="369.336" dur="4.17">&amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re not talented,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;give up,&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re a waste of time&amp;quot;</text><text start="373.506" dur="1.568">and she was very, very depressed.</text><text start="375.074" dur="2.302">And then she came across 
these five principles,</text><text start="377.376" dur="2.538">she moved to Brazil and she applied them</text><text start="379.914" dur="2.681">and in six months 
she was fluent in Portuguese,</text><text start="382.605" dur="1.635">so talent doesn&amp;#39;t matter.</text><text start="384.508" dur="4.214">People also think that immersion in a new 
country is the way to learn a language.</text><text start="388.722" dur="2.586">But look around Hong Kong, 
look at all the westerners</text><text start="391.308" dur="3.327">who&amp;#39;ve been here for 10 years, 
who don&amp;#39;t speak a word of Chinese.</text><text start="395.587" dur="3.497">Look at all the Chinese living in 
America, Britain, Australia, Canada</text><text start="399.084" dur="3.881">have been there 10, 20 years 
and they don&amp;#39;t speak any English.</text><text start="403.84" dur="1.994">Immersion per se does not work.</text><text start="405.834" dur="2.838">Why? Because a drowning man 
cannot learn to swim.</text><text start="409.873" dur="2.601">When you don&amp;#39;t speak a language, 
you&amp;#39;re like a baby.</text><text start="412.474" dur="1.985">And if you drop yourself into a context</text><text start="414.459" dur="3.68">which is all adults talking about stuff 
over your head, you won&amp;#39;t learn.</text><text start="419.032" dur="3.335">So, what are the five principles 
that you need to pay attention to?</text><text start="422.367" dur="2.373">First: the four words,</text><text start="424.74" dur="2.01">attention, meaning, relevance and memory,</text><text start="426.75" dur="2.926">and these interconnect in very, 
very important ways.</text><text start="430.214" dur="2.25">Especially when you&amp;#39;re talking 
about learning.</text><text start="432.474" dur="2.459">Come with me on a journey 
through a forest.</text><text start="434.933" dur="2.373">You go on a walk through a forest</text><text start="437.306" dur="3.577">and you see something like this... 
Little marks on a tree,</text><text start="440.883" dur="2.074">maybe you pay attention, maybe you don&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="443.957" dur="2.31">You go another 50 metres 
and you see this...</text><text start="446.267" dur="2.777">You should be paying attention.</text><text start="449.684" dur="3.526">Another 50 metres, if you haven&amp;#39;t been 
paying attention, you see this...</text><text start="453.401" dur="3.174">And at this point,
you&amp;#39;re paying attention.</text><text start="457.207" dur="3.004">And you&amp;#39;ve just learned that this...
is important,</text><text start="460.211" dur="2.626">it&amp;#39;s relevant 
because it means this,</text><text start="462.837" dur="4.654">and anything that is related, 
any information related to your survival</text><text start="468.037" dur="2.235">is stuff that you&amp;#39;re going to pay
attention to</text><text start="470.272" dur="2.007">and therefore you&amp;#39;re going
to remember it.</text><text start="472.279" dur="1.949">If it&amp;#39;s related to your personal goals,</text><text start="474.228" dur="2.042">then you&amp;#39;re going to pay attention to it.</text><text start="476.27" dur="2.285">If it&amp;#39;s relevant, 
you&amp;#39;re going to remember it.</text><text start="478.93" dur="2.816">So, the first rule, 
first principle for learning a language</text><text start="481.756" dur="2.553">is focus on language content 
that is relevant to you.</text><text start="484.309" dur="1.757">Which brings us to tools.</text><text start="487.22" dur="4.079">We master tools by using tools 
and we learn tools the fastest</text><text start="491.299" dur="2.616">when they are relevant to us.</text><text start="494.484" dur="1.273">So let me share a story.</text><text start="495.757" dur="1.62">A keyboard is a tool.</text><text start="498.192" dur="3.582">Typing Chinese a certain way, 
there are methods for this. That&amp;#39;s a tool.</text><text start="501.774" dur="2.388">I had a colleague many years ago</text><text start="504.988" dur="2.663">who went to night school; 
Tuesday night, Thursday night,</text><text start="507.651" dur="2.324">two hours each time, practicing at home,</text><text start="509.975" dur="3.684">she spent nine months, 
and she did not learn to type Chinese.</text><text start="514.52" dur="1.878">And one night we had a crisis.</text><text start="516.587" dur="3.643">We had 48 hours to deliver 
a training manual in Chinese.</text><text start="520.636" dur="2.095">And she got the job, 
and I can guarantee you</text><text start="522.731" dur="2.006">in 48 hours, she learned to type Chinese</text><text start="524.737" dur="2.906">because it was relevant,
it was meaningful, it was important,</text><text start="527.643" dur="2.503">she was using a tool to create value.</text><text start="530.156" dur="3.391">So the second principle for learning 
a language is to use your language</text><text start="533.547" dur="3.264">as a tool to communicate 
right from day one.</text><text start="537.688" dur="1.363">As a kid does.</text><text start="539.889" dur="3.075">When I first arrived in China, 
I didn&amp;#39;t speak a word of Chinese,</text><text start="543.919" dur="3.516">and on my second week, 
I got to take a train ride overnight.</text><text start="547.948" dur="2.193">I spent eight hours sitting 
in the dining car</text><text start="550.141" dur="2.003">talking to one of the guards on the train,</text><text start="552.144" dur="2.075">he took an interest in me for some reason,</text><text start="554.219" dur="2.844">and we just chatted all night in Chinese</text><text start="557.063" dur="3.016">and he was drawing pictures and 
making movements with his hands</text><text start="560.079" dur="2.707">and facial expressions 
and piece by piece by piece</text><text start="562.786" dur="1.748">I understood more and more.</text><text start="565.409" dur="2.275">But what was really cool, 
was two weeks later,</text><text start="568.237" dur="2.406">when people were talking Chinese 
around me,</text><text start="570.643" dur="1.602">I was understanding some of this</text><text start="572.245" dur="2.559">and I hadn&amp;#39;t even made any effort 
to learn that.</text><text start="575.366" dur="2.817">What had happened, 
I&amp;#39;d absorbed it that night on the train,</text><text start="578.183" dur="2.174">which brings us to the third principle.</text><text start="580.397" dur="2.553">When you first understand the message,</text><text start="583.584" dur="3.925">then you will acquire 
the language unconsciously.</text><text start="588.509" dur="2.606">And this is really, 
really well documented now,</text><text start="591.115" dur="2.051">it&amp;#39;s something called 
comprehensible input.</text><text start="593.166" dur="2.068">There&amp;#39;s 20 or 30 years 
of research on this,</text><text start="595.234" dur="1.93">Stephen Krashen, a leader in the field,</text><text start="597.164" dur="2.68">has published all sorts of 
these different studies</text><text start="599.844" dur="1.817">and this is just from one of them.</text><text start="601.661" dur="5.136">The purple bars show the scores 
on different tests for language.</text><text start="609.611" dur="4.754">The purple people were people who had 
learned by grammar and formal study,</text><text start="614.365" dur="3.059">the green ones are the ones 
who learned by comprehensible input.</text><text start="617.497" dur="3.308">So, comprehension works. 
Comprehension is key</text><text start="621.759" dur="5.388">and language learning is not about 
accumulating lots of knowledge.</text><text start="628.947" dur="3.796">In many, many ways 
it&amp;#39;s about physiological training.</text><text start="634.159" dur="3.235">A woman I know from Taiwan 
did great in English at school,</text><text start="637.394" dur="1.765">she got A grades all the way through,</text><text start="639.159" dur="2.866">went through college, A grades, 
went to the US</text><text start="642.025" dur="2.779">and found she couldn&amp;#39;t understand 
what people were saying.</text><text start="645.514" dur="3.031">And people started asking her: 
&amp;quot;Are you deaf?&amp;quot;</text><text start="649.405" dur="2.426">And she was. English deaf.</text><text start="652.815" dur="3.291">Because we have filters 
in our brain that filter in</text><text start="656.106" dur="2.478">the sounds that we are familiar with</text><text start="658.584" dur="2.964">and they filter out the sounds of 
languages that we&amp;#39;re not.</text><text start="662.633" dur="2.379">And if you can&amp;#39;t hear it, 
you won&amp;#39;t understand it,</text><text start="665.012" dur="2.708">if you can&amp;#39;t understand it, 
you&amp;#39;re not going to learn it.</text><text start="667.726" dur="2.534">So you actually have to be 
able to hear these sounds.</text><text start="670.26" dur="2.959">And there are ways to do that 
but it&amp;#39;s physiological training.</text><text start="673.219" dur="3.616">Speaking takes muscle.</text><text start="678.312" dur="2.44">You&amp;#39;ve got 43 muscles in your face,</text><text start="681.215" dur="2.493">you have to coordinate those in a way</text><text start="683.708" dur="2.793">that you make sounds that 
other people will understand.</text><text start="687.455" dur="3.175">If you&amp;#39;ve ever done a new sport 
for a couple of days,</text><text start="690.63" dur="2.696">and you know how your body feels? Hurts?</text><text start="693.802" dur="2.434">If your face is hurting, 
you&amp;#39;re doing it right.</text><text start="698.651" dur="4.108">And the final principle is state. 
Psycho-physiological state.</text><text start="703.204" dur="3.862">If you&amp;#39;re sad, angry, worried, upset, 
you&amp;#39;re not going to learn. Period.</text><text start="708.174" dur="3.65">If you&amp;#39;re happy, relaxed, 
in an Alpha brain state, curious,</text><text start="711.824" dur="2.039">you&amp;#39;re going to learn really quickly,</text><text start="713.863" dur="3.303">and very specifically you need
to be tolerant of ambiguity.</text><text start="717.513" dur="3.089">If you&amp;#39;re one of those people 
who needs to understand 100 percent</text><text start="720.602" dur="2.86">every word you&amp;#39;re hearing, 
you will go nuts,</text><text start="723.462" dur="3.638">because you&amp;#39;ll be incredibly upset 
all the time, because you&amp;#39;re not perfect.</text><text start="727.81" dur="2.801">If you&amp;#39;re comfortable with getting some, 
not getting some,</text><text start="731.03" dur="2.303">just paying attention 
to what you do understand,</text><text start="733.333" dur="3.519">you&amp;#39;re going to be fine, relaxed,
and you&amp;#39;ll be learning quickly.</text><text start="736.852" dur="3.707">So based on those five principles, 
what are the seven actions that you take?</text><text start="741.128" dur="1.873">Number one: Listen a lot.</text><text start="743.647" dur="1.882">I call it brain soaking.</text><text start="746.198" dur="1.483">You put yourself in a context</text><text start="747.691" dur="3.583">where you&amp;#39;re hearing tons and tons 
and tons of a language</text><text start="751.274" dur="2.505">and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter 
if you understand it or not.</text><text start="753.785" dur="3.524">You&amp;#39;re listening to the rhythms, 
to patterns that repeat,</text><text start="757.309" dur="2.053">you&amp;#39;re listening to things that stand out.</text><text start="759.362" dur="1.743">(Chinese) Pào nǎozi.</text><text start="761.105" dur="2.494">(English) So, just soak your brain in this.</text><text start="763.611" dur="2.919">The second action is that 
you get the meaning first,</text><text start="766.53" dur="1.939">even before you get the words.</text><text start="768.469" dur="2.8">You go: &amp;quot;Well how do I do that? 
I don&amp;#39;t know the words!&amp;quot;</text><text start="771.269" dur="3.624">Well, you understand what these 
different postures mean.</text><text start="775.267" dur="4.925">Human communication is body language 
in many, many ways, so much body language.</text><text start="780.192" dur="3.209">From body language you can 
understand a lot of communication,</text><text start="783.401" dur="4.292">therefore, you&amp;#39;re understanding, you&amp;#39;re 
acquiring through comprehensible input.</text><text start="787.693" dur="4.151">And you can also use patterns 
that you already know.</text><text start="791.844" dur="4.2">If you&amp;#39;re a Chinese speaker of Mandarin 
and Cantonese and you go to Vietnam,</text><text start="796.643" dur="5.673">you will understand 60 percent of what 
they say to you in daily conversation,</text><text start="802.316" dur="4.494">because Vietnamese is about 30 percent 
Mandarin, 30 percent Cantonese.</text><text start="808.964" dur="2.349">The third action: Start mixing.</text><text start="811.463" dur="1.87">You probably have never thought of this</text><text start="813.333" dur="2.715">but if you&amp;#39;ve got 10 verbs, 
10 nouns and 10 adjectives,</text><text start="816.068" dur="2.53">you can say 1000 different things.</text><text start="819.996" dur="2.576">Language is a creative process.</text><text start="823.279" dur="3.926">What do babies do? OK, 
&amp;quot;me&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bath&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;now&amp;quot;.</text><text start="827.62" dur="1.625">OK, that&amp;#39;s how they communicate.</text><text start="829.245" dur="2.606">So start mixing, get creative, 
have fun with it,</text><text start="831.851" dur="2.413">it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be perfect, 
just has to work.</text><text start="835.005" dur="3.207">And when you&amp;#39;re doing this, 
you focus on the core.</text><text start="838.212" dur="1.615">What does that mean?</text><text start="839.827" dur="2.838">Well, any language is 
high frequency content.</text><text start="842.665" dur="3.705">In English 1000 words covers 85 percent</text><text start="846.37" dur="2.919">of anything you&amp;#39;re ever going 
to say in daily communication.</text><text start="849.289" dur="2.726">3000 words gives you 98 percent</text><text start="852.015" dur="2.743">of anything you&amp;#39;re going to say
in daily conversation.</text><text start="854.758" dur="2.731">You got 3000 words, 
you&amp;#39;re speaking the language.</text><text start="857.489" dur="2.731">The rest is icing on the cake.</text><text start="860.22" dur="2.731">And when you&amp;#39;re just beginning 
with a new language,</text><text start="862.951" dur="2.795">start with your tool box. Week number one,</text><text start="866.438" dur="2.271">in your new language you say things like:</text><text start="868.709" dur="2.115">&amp;quot;How do you say that?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t understand,&amp;quot;</text><text start="870.824" dur="2.26">&amp;quot;repeat that please,&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;what does that mean?&amp;quot;</text><text start="873.084" dur="1.566">all in your target language.</text><text start="874.65" dur="3.316">You&amp;#39;re using it as a tool, 
making it useful to you,</text><text start="877.966" dur="3.127">it&amp;#39;s relevant to learn other things 
about the language.</text><text start="881.093" dur="2.861">By week two,
you should be saying things like:</text><text start="883.954" dur="3.7">&amp;quot;me,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;this,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;you,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;that,&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;give,&amp;quot; you know, &amp;quot;hot,&amp;quot;</text><text start="887.654" dur="4.15">simple pronouns, 
simple nouns, simple verbs,</text><text start="891.804" dur="2.52">simple adjectives, 
communicating like a baby.</text><text start="894.324" dur="3.71">And by the third or fourth week, 
you&amp;#39;re getting into &amp;quot;glue words.&amp;quot;</text><text start="899.126" dur="4.127">&amp;quot;Although,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;but,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;therefore,&amp;quot; 
these are logical transformers</text><text start="903.253" dur="4.855">that tie bits of a language together, 
allowing you to make more complex meaning.</text><text start="908.108" dur="2.191">At that point you&amp;#39;re talking.</text><text start="910.96" dur="3.436">And when you&amp;#39;re doing that, 
you should get yourself a language parent.</text><text start="915.703" dur="2.975">If you look at how 
children and parents interact,</text><text start="918.678" dur="1.745">you&amp;#39;ll understand what this means.</text><text start="921.113" dur="3.807">When a child is speaking, it&amp;#39;ll be using 
simple words, simple combinations,</text><text start="924.99" dur="3.668">sometimes quite strange, 
sometimes very strange pronunciation,</text><text start="928.658" dur="3.386">other people from outside the family 
don&amp;#39;t understand it.</text><text start="932.828" dur="1.961">But the parents do.</text><text start="934.789" dur="4.412">And so the kid has a safe environment, 
gets confidence.</text><text start="939.201" dur="2.838">The parents talk to the children 
with body language</text><text start="942.039" dur="3.081">and with simple language they 
know the child understands.</text><text start="945.532" dur="2.851">So you have a comprehensible input 
environment that&amp;#39;s safe,</text><text start="948.383" dur="3.92">we know it works; otherwise none of you 
would speak your mother tongue.</text><text start="952.842" dur="1.857">So you get yourself a language parent,</text><text start="954.699" dur="2.137">who&amp;#39;s somebody interested in you 
as a person</text><text start="956.836" dur="2.808">who will communicate with you 
essentially as an equal,</text><text start="959.644" dur="2.317">but pay attention to help you 
understand the message.</text><text start="964.278" dur="2.317">There are four rules of a language parent.</text><text start="966.595" dur="2.139">Spouses are not very good at this, OK?</text><text start="968.734" dur="1.16">But the four rules are,</text><text start="969.894" dur="2.932">first of all, they will work hard 
to understand what you mean</text><text start="972.826" dur="2.452">even when you&amp;#39;re way off beat.</text><text start="975.278" dur="2.693">Secondly, they will never 
correct your mistakes.</text><text start="978.71" dur="3.673">Thirdly, they will feed back 
their understanding of what you are saying</text><text start="982.383" dur="3.856">so that you can respond appropriately 
and get that feedback</text><text start="986.239" dur="2.593">and then they will use 
words that you know.</text><text start="989.863" dur="3.325">The sixth thing you have to do, 
is copy the face.</text><text start="993.188" dur="2.082">You got to get the muscles working right,</text><text start="995.27" dur="3.327">so you can sound in a way that 
people will understand you.</text><text start="999.26" dur="1.625">There&amp;#39;s a couple of things you do.</text><text start="1000.885" dur="3.503">One is that you hear how it feels, 
and feel how it sounds</text><text start="1004.388" dur="3.189">which means you have a feedback loop 
operating in your face,</text><text start="1007.577" dur="3.077">but ideally if you can look at 
a native speaker</text><text start="1010.654" dur="2.017">and just observe 
how they use their face,</text><text start="1012.671" dur="2.865">let your unconscious mind 
absorb the rules,</text><text start="1015.536" dur="2.395">then you&amp;#39;re going to be 
able to pick it up.</text><text start="1017.931" dur="3.877">And if you can&amp;#39;t get a native speaker 
to look at, you can use stuff like this...</text><text start="1022.329" dur="9.64">(Female voice) Sing, song, 
king, stung, hung.</text><text start="1032.475" dur="3.589">(Chris Lonsdale) And the final idea here, 
the final action you need to take</text><text start="1036.064" dur="2.14">is something that I call &amp;quot;direct connect&amp;quot;.</text><text start="1038.204" dur="3.165">What does this mean? Well most people 
learning a second language</text><text start="1041.369" dur="3.554">sort of take the mother tongue words 
and the target words and go over them</text><text start="1044.923" dur="3.787">again and again in their mind to try 
and remember them. Really inefficient.</text><text start="1048.918" dur="2.226">What you need to do is realise that</text><text start="1051.144" dur="3.256">everything you know is an image 
inside your mind, it&amp;#39;s feelings,</text><text start="1054.4" dur="2.336">if you talk about fire, 
you can smell the smoke,</text><text start="1056.736" dur="2.626">you can hear the crackling, 
you can see the flames,</text><text start="1059.362" dur="3.487">so what you do, is you go into 
that imagery and all of that memory</text><text start="1062.849" dur="4.44">and you come out with another pathway. 
So I call it &amp;quot;same box, different path&amp;quot;.</text><text start="1067.289" dur="2.75">You come out of that pathway 
and you build it over time,</text><text start="1070.039" dur="3.629">you become more and more skilled 
at just connecting the new sounds</text><text start="1073.668" dur="4.315">to those images that you already have, 
into that internal representation.</text><text start="1078.798" dur="2.942">And over time you even become naturally 
good at that process,</text><text start="1081.76" dur="1.782">that becomes unconscious.</text><text start="1083.582" dur="4.792">So, there are five principles that you 
need to work with, seven actions,</text><text start="1088.374" dur="2.563">if you do any of them, 
you&amp;#39;re going to improve.</text><text start="1090.937" dur="3.084">And remember these are things 
under your control as the learner.</text><text start="1094.021" dur="3.942">Do them all and you&amp;#39;re going to be 
fluent in a second language in six months.</text><text start="1097.963" dur="1.389">Thank you.</text><text start="1099.352" dur="0.78">(Applause)</text></transcript>

year since The Beatles.</text><text start="17.94" dur="1.82">And their music video for &amp;quot;Boy With Luv&amp;quot;</text><text start="19.76" dur="2">smashed the record for the most watched</text><text start="21.76" dur="2.36">YouTube video in 24 hours</text><text start="24.12" dur="2.32">when it was released in April 2019.</text><text start="26.44" dur="2.47">Forbes listed the group

entertainers of 2019.</text><text start="31.8" dur="3.73">Ranked at No. 43, they earned $57 million</text><text start="35.53" dur="2">in pre-tax income in the last year.</text><text start="37.53" dur="1.56">A majority of those earnings came from</text><text start="39.09" dur="2.51">their &amp;quot;Love Yourself:
Speak Yourself&amp;quot; world tour,</text><text start="41.6" dur="4.79">which grossed $44 million from
just six US stadium shows.</text><text start="46.39" dur="2.22">And that is only part of their fortune.</text><text start="48.61" dur="2.85">Here&amp;#39;s how the members of BTS
make and spend their money.</text><text start="52.57" dur="2.35">BTS amassed their fortune
through their music,</text><text start="54.92" dur="3.24">album sales, concerts,
merchandise, and brand deals.</text><text start="58.16" dur="3.19">Their April 2019 album,
&amp;quot;Map of the Soul: Persona,&amp;quot;</text><text start="61.35" dur="3.75">sold nearly 3.4 million
copies within a month</text><text start="65.1" dur="2.27">and set a record high in South Korea.</text><text start="67.37" dur="1.75">They&amp;#39;ve also landed endorsement deals</text><text start="69.12" dur="1.14">and partnerships with brands</text><text start="70.26" dur="2.68">like Coca-Cola, Hyundai, and Puma.</text><text start="72.94" dur="1.97">The group seems to turn
anything they touch</text><text start="74.91" dur="1.72">into a major success.</text><text start="76.63" dur="3.12">In 2018, Hyundai made them
global brand ambassadors</text><text start="79.75" dur="1.9">for its new Palisade SUV.</text><text start="81.65" dur="2.06">BTS released two concert films</text><text start="83.71" dur="2.14">that also contributed to their cash flow.</text><text start="85.85" dur="2.01">Their 2018 movie, &amp;quot;Burn the Stage,&amp;quot;</text><text start="87.86" dur="2.8">grossed over $20 million worldwide.</text><text start="90.66" dur="2.92">And their most recent film,
&amp;quot;Love Yourself in Seoul,&amp;quot;</text><text start="93.58" dur="1.766">brought in over $10 million</text><text start="95.346" dur="2.5">during its January 2019 release.</text><text start="97.846" dur="3.324">BTS is worth over $3.6 billion a year</text><text start="101.17" dur="1.63">to South Korea&amp;#39;s economy.</text><text start="102.8" dur="2.07">They increased South Korea&amp;#39;s popularity,</text><text start="104.87" dur="2.29">contributing to a surge in tourism.</text><text start="107.16" dur="3.22">An estimated 800,000
tourists reportedly chose</text><text start="110.38" dur="3.96">South Korea as their travel
destination because of BTS.</text><text start="114.34" dur="1.93">Their popularity also boosted the appeal</text><text start="116.27" dur="1.47">of South Korean products,</text><text start="117.74" dur="2.35">such as clothes, cosmetics, and food.</text><text start="120.09" dur="1.95">eBay in particular saw an increase</text><text start="122.04" dur="2.46">in merchandise sales thanks to BTS.</text><text start="124.5" dur="2.172">eBay Korea said in April 2019</text><text start="126.672" dur="2.624">that sales had risen by more than 50%</text><text start="129.296" dur="1.475">since the previous April.</text><text start="130.771" dur="2.039">The country now has at
least a billion dollars&amp;#39;</text><text start="132.81" dur="3.42">worth of consumer exports
associated with BTS.</text><text start="136.23" dur="2.27">And they&amp;#39;re projected to
bring in an economic value</text><text start="138.5" dur="3.68">of $37 billion over the next 10 years.</text><text start="142.18" dur="2.11">Talk about being a national treasure.</text><text start="144.29" dur="1.83">K-pop isn&amp;#39;t new to the world.</text><text start="146.12" dur="3.196">Back in the late 2000s,
before BTS debuted,</text><text start="149.316" dur="1.824">many groups were slowly paving the way</text><text start="151.14" dur="2.25">for the genre&amp;#39;s growing popularity.</text><text start="153.39" dur="3.07">BTS was formed by a company
called Big Hit Entertainment.</text><text start="156.46" dur="3.32">But in 2007, Big Hit almost went bankrupt.</text><text start="159.78" dur="3.24">CEO Bang Si-hyuk managed
to keep the company afloat</text><text start="163.02" dur="3.36">with the success of previous
K-pop groups he had managed.</text><text start="166.38" dur="1.98">He formed BTS in 2010,</text><text start="168.36" dur="2.97">and the group officially debuted in 2013.</text><text start="171.33" dur="2.93">Because BTS struggled with
media exposure in South Korea,</text><text start="174.26" dur="2.51">they took a nontraditional
marketing approach</text><text start="176.77" dur="2.72">by connecting with their
fans through social media,</text><text start="179.49" dur="2.66">and they slowly built
up a dedicated fan base</text><text start="182.15" dur="1.79">known as the ARMY.</text><text start="183.94" dur="2.36">Bang attributes BTS&amp;#39;
success to the connection</text><text start="186.3" dur="1.76">they share with their fans.</text><text start="188.06" dur="2.58">This led to sold-out
concerts, record sales,</text><text start="190.64" dur="3.14">and being the world&amp;#39;s most
tweeted-about celebrities.</text><text start="193.78" dur="2.12">Thanks to BTS, Big Hit Entertainment</text><text start="195.9" dur="3.166">is worth an estimated $2 billion.</text><text start="199.066" dur="3.744">And Bang alone is worth $770 million.</text><text start="202.81" dur="1.71">With his current fortune, Bang rented</text><text start="204.52" dur="4.13">a $6.5 million mansion for
BTS in Hannam the Hill,</text><text start="208.65" dur="3.06">one of the most expensive
complexes in South Korea.</text><text start="211.71" dur="1.38">But how do the members of K-pop&amp;#39;s</text><text start="213.09" dur="1.91">richest band spend their money?</text><text start="215" dur="1.48">Although they share a mansion,</text><text start="216.48" dur="1.91">some of them still have
their own apartments.</text><text start="218.39" dur="3.72">Jin reportedly spent $1.7 million in cash</text><text start="222.11" dur="2.03">on his apartment at Hannam the Hill.</text><text start="224.14" dur="2.19">J-Hope and Jungkook also bought apartments</text><text start="226.33" dur="2.3">in the Seoul Forest Trimage, known as</text><text start="228.63" dur="2.76">one of the most luxurious
apartments in Seoul.</text><text start="231.39" dur="4.81">J-Hope bought his for a reported
$1.6 million back in 2016,</text><text start="236.2" dur="4.53">while Jungkook reportedly
spent $1.74 million in cash</text><text start="240.73" dur="3.275">when he purchased his unit in late 2018.</text><text start="244.005" dur="2.265">Suga also bought a $3 million apartment</text><text start="246.27" dur="3.18">in the Hannam district
around the end of 2018.</text><text start="249.45" dur="3.615">The boys are also known for
their bold fashion and style.</text><text start="253.065" dur="1.322">While it&amp;#39;s common for celebrities</text><text start="254.387" dur="2.79">to land sponsorships with luxury brands,</text><text start="257.177" dur="2.683">BTS reportedly doesn&amp;#39;t
accept these kinds of deals,</text><text start="259.86" dur="2.508">instead choosing the brands
they actually want to wear.</text><text start="262.368" dur="1.582">Some of their favorite luxury pieces</text><text start="263.95" dur="3.51">come from Supreme, Gucci,
Givenchy, and Mastermind,</text><text start="267.46" dur="3.34">each ranging from hundreds
to thousands of dollars.</text><text start="270.8" dur="1.44">In addition to luxury living,</text><text start="272.24" dur="2.4">some of the members have exotic pets.</text><text start="274.64" dur="3.27">Jin currently has a leucistic
sugar glider named Gukmul,</text><text start="277.91" dur="1.76">which translates to &amp;quot;soup.&amp;quot;</text><text start="279.67" dur="4.07">Sugar gliders can cost anywhere
between $100 to $5,000,</text><text start="283.74" dur="2.09">and leucistic sugar gliders typically cost</text><text start="285.83" dur="3.31">between $1,500 and $2,500.</text><text start="289.14" dur="2.97">The other members have
more common household pets.</text><text start="292.11" dur="1.94">V owns the most pets in the group.</text><text start="294.05" dur="2.17">He has four dogs and one cat.</text><text start="296.22" dur="1.98">While he hasn&amp;#39;t confirmed
the breeds of his pets,</text><text start="298.2" dur="2.73">fans speculate he has a teacup Pomeranian,</text><text start="300.93" dur="2.81">a Korean Jindo, and a
chinchilla Persian cat,</text><text start="303.74" dur="2.17">all the expensive breeds.</text><text start="305.91" dur="2.25">Suga also has a toy poodle named Holly.</text><text start="308.16" dur="2.1">Toy poodles can cost thousands of dollars,</text><text start="310.26" dur="1.92">depending on gender and coat.</text><text start="312.18" dur="1.78">Although they have a lavish lifestyle,</text><text start="313.96" dur="3.13">the BTS members are known for
their humble personalities</text><text start="317.09" dur="2.19">and don&amp;#39;t publicly flaunt their fortunes.</text><text start="319.28" dur="1.94">The members have donated
to many charities,</text><text start="321.22" dur="1.82">including food banks, animal shelters,</text><text start="323.04" dur="1.43">and children&amp;#39;s medical funds.</text><text start="324.47" dur="2.26">And in 2017, they partnered with UNICEF</text><text start="326.73" dur="2.24">to launch the Love Myself campaign,</text><text start="328.97" dur="1.78">which is aimed at
promoting self-confidence</text><text start="330.75" dur="1.88">and ending violence.</text><text start="332.63" dur="3.68">The campaign has raised
over $1.4 million worldwide.</text><text start="336.31" dur="3.75">And in September 2018, BTS

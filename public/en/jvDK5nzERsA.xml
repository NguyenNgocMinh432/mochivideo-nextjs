<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.39" dur="6.529">I want a partner like yours. I want friends
like that guy. I want eyebrows like that girl.</text><text start="6.919" dur="5.892">I want his popularity, looks, money. I want
her bravery, intelligence and happiness. I</text><text start="12.811" dur="5.319">don’t actively think about comparing myself
to these people. It’s inevitable; a natural</text><text start="18.13" dur="5.67">instinct, as we collect information about
our surroundings to evaluate how we’re doing</text><text start="23.8" dur="4.83">in life. When I compare and I measure up,
I tend to feel good about myself. When I compare</text><text start="28.63" dur="3.159">and I measure down, I’ll often feel bad
about myself.</text><text start="31.789" dur="6.572">Though, not all self-comparison leads to envy,
envy always starts with self-comparison, but</text><text start="38.361" dur="3.038">it goes far beyond simply wanting something…</text><text start="41.399" dur="5.87">See, not only do I want what you have, but
I don’t want you to have what you have.</text><text start="47.269" dur="5.86">In fact, I can’t stand that you get to have
it and I don’t. It’s unfair. I’m entitled</text><text start="53.129" dur="5.3">to everything that everyone else gets to have.
Why should I be any less?</text><text start="58.429" dur="5.56">If you were a little bit less happy, then
I’d get to be happier. If your relationship</text><text start="63.989" dur="5.211">wasn’t going so damn well, I’d feel better
about being single. Everyone seems to like</text><text start="69.2" dur="6.29">you and speak so fondly of you, so when someone
finally criticizes you, it’s deeply rewarding</text><text start="75.49" dur="7.43">to me. In fact, you’re not even that smart,
or pretty, or funny or accomplished. You have</text><text start="82.92" dur="6.58">something that I want; I feel inferior to
you. So, in order to at the very least feel</text><text start="89.5" dur="6.299">equal to you, I need to either bring you down,
or bring myself up. And since it’s easier</text><text start="95.799" dur="6.031">bringing others down than it is working on
lifting myself up, that’s what I’ll try</text><text start="101.83" dur="6.789">to do. Yeah, so something like that is an
example of how envy may play out in a person’s</text><text start="108.619" dur="1">mind.</text><text start="109.619" dur="6.241">Envy is when we see someone who has something
we want, and so now we experience a gap between</text><text start="115.86" dur="3.96">where we currently are and where we want to
be; what we currently have and what we want</text><text start="119.82" dur="7.01">to have. And it’s how we respond to such
gaps, both emotionally and through our actions,</text><text start="126.83" dur="3.429">that we should pay very close attention to…</text><text start="130.259" dur="6.031">I like to think of envy as a spectrum, where
on one end, it’s very hostile, similar to</text><text start="136.29" dur="4.729">what I demonstrated in the beginning, and
on the other end, it’s very non-hostile.</text><text start="141.019" dur="6.711">And I figured we could take a trip down memory
lane to explore both ends with the help of</text><text start="147.73" dur="5.35">examples from my life.</text><text start="153.08" dur="8.93">The prime of my envy was probably in my early
teens, and what I’d envy the most was other</text><text start="162.01" dur="6.47">girls looks, specifically their bodies. I
was teased for being too skinny; I don’t</text><text start="168.48" dur="6.64">think a day went by where someone didn’t
make a comment about my weight, or at the</text><text start="175.12" dur="9.259">very least, someone would grab by wrist like
this and say something like, “oh my god</text><text start="184.379" dur="12.94">you’re so skinny!”, or “watch out you’ll
break”.</text><text start="197.319" dur="6.361">I remember liking this boy when I was like
15, and him not wanting to be with me because</text><text start="203.68" dur="7.41">he said I didn’t look womanly enough, and
then he sent me a photo of another girl’s</text><text start="211.09" dur="7.57">body to “show me what a real woman is supposed
to look like” and I remember saving that</text><text start="218.66" dur="8.109">photo and looking at it over and over again,
wishing I looked like that. I would resent</text><text start="226.769" dur="7.36">the girl in that photo, or really, any girl
whose body looked like hers.</text><text start="234.129" dur="5.571">High school was a bit better. Although I’d
still get commented on, it didn’t happen</text><text start="239.7" dur="6.172">as frequently, but I’d still feel insecure
and often tried hiding certain parts of my</text><text start="245.872" dur="6.067">body. I remember I had this long cross-over
bag that I’d wear pretty much every day</text><text start="251.939" dur="9.851">to cover up my small bum. Oh my god, thinking
back on that is so sad. I wish I would just</text><text start="261.79" dur="8.349">go back and tell that girl that IT DOESN’T
MATTER, NO ONE ACTUALLY CARES. YOU’RE BEAUTIFUL!</text><text start="270.139" dur="8.941">But since I can’t do that, I’ll tell you,
if you’re in a similar situation.</text><text start="279.08" dur="6.45">College was completely different. No one cared
what anyone looked like, and so, I didn’t</text><text start="285.53" dur="6.82">care either. I’d still feel insecure at
times, but I was able to fully acknowledge</text><text start="292.35" dur="5.59">someone else’s beautiful figure without
feeling any negative emotion towards them</text><text start="297.94" dur="10.26">or towards myself. And then, upon graduating,
I had left most of that in the past. I was</text><text start="308.2" dur="8.21">free of intrusive thoughts, and free of envy
in that regard, and that’s where I still</text><text start="316.41" dur="1.08">am to this day.</text><text start="317.49" dur="5.33">So, let’s start digging into what actually
happened during those years. It’s important</text><text start="322.82" dur="7.61">to note here that according to studies, envy
typically declines with age, meaning teens</text><text start="330.43" dur="4.03">experience it more than adults. So, I’d
say that’s the first thing that happened.</text><text start="334.46" dur="11.6">I simply grew older. Second, the whole reason
I got to the point of feeling so inadequate</text><text start="346.06" dur="7.68">was because of the image of what my body SHOULD
look like that had been pushed down my throat</text><text start="353.74" dur="4.4">for so many years by other people, and I had
believed in it.</text><text start="358.14" dur="5.13">But once I changed my environment and hence
changed my surroundings, aka going from school</text><text start="363.27" dur="6.23">to college, and no one was there to remind
me of my “inadequacy”, I guess I simply</text><text start="369.5" dur="7.38">forgot about it. I was now the sole judge
of what I felt when I looked myself in the</text><text start="376.88" dur="5.38">mirror, and it turned out, I liked what I
saw, and I no longer needed anyone else’s</text><text start="382.26" dur="5.43">permission to do that. By the way, this is
not to say that we should blame other people</text><text start="387.69" dur="6.91">for our envy and our insecurities, I’m simply
sharing how it played out for me in this particular</text><text start="394.6" dur="1">case.</text><text start="395.6" dur="6.61">Upon graduating, I experienced a different
kind of envy: I envied people who seemed to</text><text start="402.21" dur="5.93">have their jobs and careers all figured out
and who seemed happy with what they were doing,</text><text start="408.14" dur="9.95">because I didn’t have that. I tried to justify
my position of dissatisfaction, by thinking</text><text start="418.09" dur="6.12">things like “well, the whole reason they
can even live their dreams is because they…”…were</text><text start="424.21" dur="6.27">luckier, they were better off. They got help.
They had access to things I didn’t have</text><text start="430.48" dur="2.25">access to and whatnot.</text><text start="432.73" dur="5.14">Even though there might’ve been some truth
to that, it was all just an attempt to make</text><text start="437.87" dur="6.03">myself feel better for not having what they
had by attempting to minimize their accomplishments.</text><text start="443.9" dur="6.78">This is something we often do when experiencing
envy. Now, did it work? Did I feel better?</text><text start="450.68" dur="11.291">No. Of course not. See, at best, a victim
narrative will have you remaining stuck, but</text><text start="461.971" dur="7.659">typically, it’ll move you backwards. Because
now, not only do you feel dissatisfied with</text><text start="469.63" dur="4.21">life or career or whatever it might be, but
you also feel resentful.</text><text start="473.84" dur="5.48">Now, here’s where we get to the part that
I think is really worth reflecting on; it’s</text><text start="479.32" dur="6.77">how I currently deal with any envy that I
may experience. So, what I ended up realizing</text><text start="486.09" dur="8.09">was that, really, envy wasn’t about any
specific person, it was only about what they</text><text start="494.18" dur="10.32">had, which in this example, was an enjoyable
career. And in thinking this way, in moving</text><text start="504.5" dur="7.17">the person out of the equation, in separating
the message from the messenger; the possession</text><text start="511.67" dur="4.76">or position from the person, I was able to
do two things:</text><text start="516.43" dur="5.4">1. instead of viewing anyone who possessed
something that I wanted in a hostile way,</text><text start="521.83" dur="8.22">I started viewing them as people who had enlightened
me; someone who had helped me identify a gap</text><text start="530.05" dur="7.94">in my life, perhaps even someone I could set
as example or teacher. 2. Secondly, I was</text><text start="537.99" dur="8.03">able to get more clarity on what exactly it
was that I was envying, and I could decide</text><text start="546.02" dur="1.66">what action should follow.</text><text start="547.68" dur="5.55">See, in every situation, there’s the option
of doing something useful, doing something</text><text start="553.23" dur="6.77">that isn’t useful or perhaps even harmful,
or doing nothing at all. How do we choose?</text><text start="560" dur="6.23">I often find myself returning to the serenity
prayer: “God grant me the serenity to accept</text><text start="566.23" dur="6.94">the things I cannot change; Courage to change
the things I can; And wisdom to know the difference.”</text><text start="573.17" dur="4.79">Now, I already have a video about quitting
my job and pursuing what I’m doing now,</text><text start="577.96" dur="5.27">so I won’t get into it here. But this would
be an example of non-hostile envy, where my</text><text start="583.23" dur="2.31">envy actually led me to something good.</text><text start="585.54" dur="1">Body 3</text><text start="586.54" dur="6.23">Now, this all begs the question: - Is envy
always a sign that we lack something we ought</text><text start="592.77" dur="7.24">to be pursuing? And is the best thing to do
when experiencing envy to seek to improve</text><text start="600.01" dur="3.01">ourselves or improve our situation?</text><text start="603.02" dur="7.9">Well, I definitely think self-improvement
is the better option as opposed to self-destruction</text><text start="610.92" dur="7.25">or engaging in the destruction of others,
but there’s also the option of simply doing</text><text start="618.17" dur="8.82">nothing. There may be a lot of things we envy,
that doesn’t mean that having all of those</text><text start="626.99" dur="7.69">things would improve our lives or make us
happier. Every single emotion we feel is not</text><text start="634.68" dur="7.54">a sign that we need to change something. Sometimes,
we can just let ourselves acknowledge a feeling,</text><text start="642.22" dur="9.35">and then do nothing about it. Like seeing
a sailboat out on a lake; not attempting to</text><text start="651.57" dur="6.29">throw rocks at it, but also not attempting
to build your own. But simply letting it pass</text><text start="657.86" dur="1.21">you.</text><text start="659.07" dur="8.12">Now, sometimes, we may envy someone for a
skill they have. Good news is, skills are</text><text start="667.19" dur="6.07">something that we, ourselves, can learn, by
using Skillshare for example, who is our sponsor</text><text start="673.26" dur="1">today.</text><text start="674.26" dur="4.28">Skillshare is an online learning community

so much more for me to explore. I&amp;#39;m currently</text><text start="692.68" dur="5.17">taking this class called “Context is Key:
Social Media Strategy in a Noisy Online World”</text><text start="697.85" dur="5.82">and it’s taught by none other than Gary
Vaynerchuck. It&amp;#39;s very thorough, and I think</text><text start="703.67" dur="5.36">it&amp;#39;s really great how he covers so many different
social media platforms in this class, such</text><text start="709.03" dur="1.9">as Twitter and Instagram and Pinterest.</text><text start="710.93" dur="4.74">If you would like to check out that class

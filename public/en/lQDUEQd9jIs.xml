<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="2.3" dur="1.44">Aww yeah!</text><text start="3.74" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m back with another lesson
with Disney movies,</text><text start="6.74" dur="7.22">this time with scenes from the classic Frozen
and the new, just-released Frozen II.</text><text start="13.96" dur="3.62">This will be a great opportunity for you
to get all warmed up for it</text><text start="17.58" dur="5.84">and to learn some specific vocabulary related
to the weather, the seasons, and even poetry.</text><text start="23.42" dur="3.96">And if you&amp;#39;re new here, every week we help
you to understand fast-speaking natives</text><text start="27.38" dur="2.36">without getting lost,
without missing the jokes,</text><text start="29.74" dur="1.74">and without subtitles!</text><text start="31.48" dur="5.08">Just like Aarsh, who says that we helped
him to pass his recent English exam.</text><text start="36.56" dur="3.28">And we&amp;#39;ll help you to reach your English
learning goals too —</text><text start="39.84" dur="2.92">all you have to do is hit that Subscribe button
and the bell down below</text><text start="42.76" dur="2.24">so you don&amp;#39;t miss any of our new lessons.</text><text start="45" dur="4.4">Finally, I&amp;#39;ve got a very special opportunity
to tell you about in just a little bit.</text><text start="49.4" dur="5.22">But, for now, let&amp;#39;s jump into this
fun and entertaining lesson with Frozen!</text><text start="462.24" dur="4.96">So, you can learn a ton by doing the things
you love, like watching series like Friends,</text><text start="467.2" dur="1.96">and movies like Frozen,</text><text start="469.16" dur="1.96">but, is it enough?</text><text start="471.12" dur="2.7">Well, in my experience learning six
different languages,</text><text start="473.82" dur="5.66">I have always found that native media
and keeping it fun are essential parts of the process.</text><text start="479.48" dur="2.96">But, sooner or later I would always get stuck.</text><text start="482.44" dur="3.6">And this made me lack confidence
because I knew I was making mistakes,</text><text start="486.04" dur="4.16">but, I didn&amp;#39;t really know what I needed to
focus on learning to correct them.</text><text start="490.2" dur="3.64">And my friends weren&amp;#39;t correcting me,
and they didn&amp;#39;t really know either</text><text start="493.84" dur="2.1">how to explain the grammar to me.</text><text start="495.94" dur="5.72">So at some point, just music, books,
and series aren&amp;#39;t enough.</text><text start="501.66" dur="2.04">You need the guidance of a teacher.</text><text start="503.7" dur="4.52">So for me, having the guidance of a professional
who has tons of experience helping people</text><text start="508.22" dur="2.928">who are having the same learning
challenges is essential,</text><text start="511.148" dur="3.992">and that&amp;#39;s why I am excited to present
a great new opportunity</text><text start="515.14" dur="1.96">from our friends over at Lingoda.</text><text start="517.1" dur="3.16">They are going to help you to improve
your speaking skills</text><text start="520.26" dur="3.74">and your confidence quickly,
in just a matter of months.</text><text start="524" dur="5.18">And the great part about this promotion is that
when you fully participate in all of the classes,</text><text start="529.18" dur="2.94">you can get a 100% refund!</text><text start="532.12" dur="2.82">So, I&amp;#39;ve tried Lingoda, and it is fantastic!</text><text start="534.94" dur="2.94">You get to learn with native teachers anytime you want,</text><text start="537.88" dur="4.8">and they give you all of the materials you need
so you know exactly what you need to focus on.</text><text start="542.68" dur="4.26">So over the past few years,
Lingoda has helped 20,000 learners just like you</text><text start="546.94" dur="5.02">to transform their lives getting opportunities
to work and study abroad.</text><text start="551.96" dur="4.88">You can see some of their inspiring stories on
Lingoda&amp;#39;s website by clicking the link down below,</text><text start="556.85" dur="2.59">and definitely check out their Instagram as well.</text><text start="559.44" dur="3">So, what exactly is this promotion?</text><text start="562.44" dur="4">So, Lingoda has a motivating study
challenge called the SPRINT.</text><text start="566.44" dur="3.68">And this is really fantastic because
it gets you committed to learning.</text><text start="570.12" dur="2.96">As both a coach and a language learner myself,</text><text start="573.08" dur="3.34">I know that having this accountability
is absolutely crucial.</text><text start="576.42" dur="5.34">Because, otherwise it&amp;#39;s too easy to
skip when you&amp;#39;re tired or busy.</text><text start="581.76" dur="4.04">And with the SUPER SPRINT,
you will be showing up every single day,</text><text start="585.8" dur="2.82">and you&amp;#39;re going to make
huge progress on your learning.</text><text start="588.62" dur="3.66">Unless you do the [regular] SPRINT,
in which you do slightly less classes.</text><text start="592.28" dur="5.5">Now, when you complete all of the classes in the
SUPER SPRINT, you will be getting a 100% refund.</text><text start="597.78" dur="3.08">And, if you complete the SPRINT,
you&amp;#39;ll get a 50% refund.</text><text start="600.86" dur="4.24">It&amp;#39;s open to all levels, whether you&amp;#39;re a beginner,
an intermediate, or advanced.</text><text start="605.1" dur="4.74">And the SPRINT begins on January 7th, 2020
and ends on April 5th.</text><text start="609.84" dur="4.7">All right, so in order to participate
you have to sign up BEFORE December 19th.</text><text start="614.54" dur="3.48">After paying your 49-euro non-refundable deposit fee,</text><text start="618.02" dur="5.68">which holds your spot, you will automatically
be signed up for a 3-month subscription.</text><text start="623.7" dur="4.1">But don&amp;#39;t worry — this deposit goes
towards paying your first month of classes.</text><text start="627.8" dur="3.72">And remember that Lingoda will
refund 100% of your tuition fee</text><text start="631.52" dur="3.1">if you complete the agreed number of classes.</text><text start="634.62" dur="2.08">There&amp;#39;s no trick or catch here.</text><text start="636.7" dur="2.4">But, be sure to read all of the terms and
conditions</text><text start="639.1" dur="3.2">as students say that this is
the key to success in the SPRINT.</text><text start="642.3" dur="4.04">And, to make it even better for you, we have 
a special discount code for you.</text><text start="646.34" dur="2.44">Just click the link down

a really awesome opportunity for you.</text><text start="661.52" dur="4.44">Just imagine if in 3 months, you could 
confidently converse with a native.</text><text start="665.96" dur="3.88">Or get an exciting new job,
or move to another country.</text><text start="669.84" dur="3.74">And you could do it all for FREE
by completing Lingoda&amp;#39;s SPRINT.</text><text start="673.58" dur="2.56">Best of luck to all of you that participate in the SPRINT,</text><text start="676.14" dur="3.24">and now, let&amp;#39;s get back to this lesson with Frozen.</text><text start="1600.34" dur="3.3">Awesome! I hope that you had
a lot of fun with this lesson with Frozen,</text><text start="1603.64" dur="4.32">and that it&amp;#39;ll help you a lot when you

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="8.23" dur="4.239">We usually avoid difficulty whenever we can,
but I try to do something difficult every</text><text start="12.469" dur="1.361">single day.</text><text start="13.83" dur="4.345">In this video, I’ll explain the three main
reasons behind why I’ve chosen this approach.</text><text start="18.175" dur="4.31">And by the end, perhaps you will be inspired
to do something difficult today yourself.</text><text start="22.485" dur="2.515">So let’s dive in.</text><text start="25" dur="3.46">This circle right here is where most people
are operating.</text><text start="28.46" dur="1.984">This is our comfort zone.</text><text start="30.444" dur="2.751">Everyone has one, and we like being in it.</text><text start="33.195" dur="2.45">Usually it looks something like this:</text><text start="35.645" dur="4.117">Going to school or a job where we do what is
 required of us to get by,</text><text start="39.762" dur="2.151">but not necessarily more than that.</text><text start="41.913" dur="4.466">Getting quick dopamine fixes throughout the
day on our phones or other devices.</text><text start="46.379" dur="4.281">Spending weekends hanging out with the same
people we&amp;#39;ve always socialized with.</text><text start="50.66" dur="4.719">Holding on to the same beliefs we&amp;#39;ve had for
years and failing to consider different opinions.</text><text start="55.379" dur="3.343">Basically it means taking the path of least
resistance.</text><text start="58.722" dur="5.193">Life becomes a predictable routine, with no
real challenges and we find ourselves stagnating.</text><text start="63.915" dur="4.768">And it&amp;#39;s easy to understand why the majority
of people stay here for most of their lives.</text><text start="68.683" dur="4.384">As the name implies, it&amp;#39;s comfortable here
since we&amp;#39;re not pushing ourselves.</text><text start="73.067" dur="3.121">At the first glance, there seems to be nothing
wrong with that.</text><text start="76.188" dur="4.882">Why would we voluntarily put ourselves in
a position of struggle, if we don&amp;#39;t have to?</text><text start="81.07" dur="4.328">But if we only live our lives in the comfort
zone, we might be unknowingly doing ourselves</text><text start="85.398" dur="1.382">an injustice.</text><text start="86.78" dur="5.27">You see, while our comfort zone is indeed
comfortable, it also has one big downside.</text><text start="92.05" dur="5.403">People who are stuck here for too long don&amp;#39;t just stagnate,
but they often regress backwards as well.</text><text start="97.453" dur="3.955">When you&amp;#39;re doing the same things, the same
way, over and over, the comfort zone itself</text><text start="101.408" dur="1.581">begins to shrink.</text><text start="102.989" dur="3.533">The things that you were comfortable with
before, are now less comfortable.</text><text start="106.522" dur="2.363">Let me give you an example.</text><text start="108.885" dur="4.184">Someone who is socially anxious, and is afraid
of social interaction, usually doesn&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="113.069" dur="1.931">the idea of meeting new people.</text><text start="115" dur="3.18">Experiencing that is outside their comfort
zone.</text><text start="118.18" dur="3.8">So instead they prefer to spend their time
alone, or if they do socialize, it&amp;#39;s with</text><text start="121.98" dur="2.232">people they already know well.</text><text start="124.212" dur="1.461">And that&amp;#39;s fine.</text><text start="125.673" dur="3.518">But let&amp;#39;s say this person starts spending
less time with their current friends, and</text><text start="129.191" dur="1.479">even more time alone.</text><text start="130.67" dur="3.617">Slowly, their current comfort zone will become
smaller.</text><text start="134.287" dur="3.846">Because they don&amp;#39;t confront their fear, the
fear becomes even bigger.</text><text start="138.133" dur="4.675">And even the idea of calling up their current
friend group might become more difficult.</text><text start="142.808" dur="5.607">So you can see how paradoxically, giving in
to current comfort, can lead to future discomfort.</text><text start="148.415" dur="4.904">When a muscle isn&amp;#39;t used for a longer period
of time, it atrophies and gets smaller because</text><text start="153.319" dur="2.638">there is no reason for it to stay big.</text><text start="155.957" dur="2.762">The same happens when we don&amp;#39;t challenge ourselves.</text><text start="158.719" dur="4.089">We become less capable of handling the obstacles
that life throws at us.</text><text start="162.808" dur="3.792">And that is the first reason why I try to
do something difficult every day.</text><text start="166.6" dur="3.777">I don&amp;#39;t want to stagnate, and I don&amp;#39;t want
the things that I&amp;#39;m comfortable with now,</text><text start="170.377" dur="2.135">become uncomfortable in the future.</text><text start="172.512" dur="4.078">However, when we push ourselves and do something
that is a little more difficult or challenging</text><text start="176.59" dur="2.44">for us, we leave the comfort zone.</text><text start="179.03" dur="2.398">Then we enter the growth zone .</text><text start="181.428" dur="4.302">This is where we struggle and we might feel
like incompetent fools, but this is exactly</text><text start="185.73" dur="2.278">where all real progress is made.</text><text start="188.008" dur="2.569">And you have probably noticed this yourself.</text><text start="190.577" dur="4.601">When working out at the gym, you don&amp;#39;t improve
if you simply lift the same weight every time.</text><text start="195.178" dur="4.61">When learning a new language, you&amp;#39;re not advancing
if you only practice what you already know.</text><text start="199.788" dur="5.096">To improve and see progress, you have to leave
the comfort zone and increase the challenge.</text><text start="204.884" dur="3.706">That might mean increasing the weights on
your lifts, or reading something new and trying</text><text start="208.59" dur="2.179">to recall that information without help.</text><text start="210.769" dur="1.87">Yes, it will be uncomfortable.</text><text start="212.639" dur="1.621">Yes, you will struggle.</text><text start="214.26" dur="2.969">And yes, you will probably feel like an idiot.</text><text start="217.229" dur="3.971">But doing anything worthwhile requires you
to go through this, because the things that</text><text start="221.2" dur="3.332">have the biggest payoff always feel difficult
in the moment.</text><text start="224.532" dur="2.216">There&amp;#39;s no improvement without challenge.</text><text start="226.748" dur="1.936">Remember that.</text><text start="228.684" dur="3.624">Of course the comfort zone isn&amp;#39;t just one
single zone for everything.</text><text start="232.308" dur="2.106">We have multiple zones.</text><text start="234.414" dur="4.245">You might be pushing yourself in some of them,
stagnating in others and even deteriorating</text><text start="238.659" dur="1.089">in some.</text><text start="239.748" dur="3.803">For example, you could be regressing backwards with your social skills,</text><text start="243.551" dur="1.449">stagnating with your work,</text><text start="245" dur="2.748">but pushing yourself to the limit at the gym. </text><text start="247.748" dur="3.57">It&amp;#39;s up to each of us to identify which zone
needs more work.</text><text start="251.318" dur="4.743">And it&amp;#39;s completely fine to stop progressing
in some areas if you&amp;#39;re happy with where you are.</text><text start="256.061" dur="3.197">There&amp;#39;s no need to push yourself at everything
you do.</text><text start="259.258" dur="5.388">But if you&amp;#39;re not happy with where you are,
there are a few ways to go from comfort to growth.</text><text start="264.646" dur="5.354">You probably already have a certain area in
mind where you&amp;#39;re kinda stuck and want to improve.</text><text start="270" dur="2.205">There are 3 ways you can go about it.</text><text start="272.205" dur="3.083">The 1st way is by doing it more consistently.</text><text start="275.288" dur="2.955">The 2nd way is by doing it more intensely.</text><text start="278.243" dur="4.105">And lastly, the 3rd way is by doing it for
longer periods of time.</text><text start="282.348" dur="4.014">All 3 of them will increase the difficulty
of whatever you want to improve on.</text><text start="286.362" dur="4.268">I think they are mostly self-explanatory,
but I&amp;#39;ll quickly go over them, using running</text><text start="290.63" dur="1.43">as an example.</text><text start="292.06" dur="2.78">Firstly, doing it more consistently simply means that</text><text start="294.84" dur="3.755">instead of running 3 days a week, you try
to raise it to 4 days.</text><text start="298.595" dur="3.115">Since you are doing it more often, it becomes
more challenging.</text><text start="301.71" dur="3.89">But this also helps consolidate the behavior
and makes it more likely for you to do it</text><text start="305.6" dur="1.53">in the future as well.</text><text start="307.13" dur="2.4">Secondly, doing it more intensely, means that you do</text><text start="309.53" dur="2.85">a more potent version of what you usually do.</text><text start="312.38" dur="4.15">This might mean trying something new, like
running sprints, or running up a hill.</text><text start="316.53" dur="5.098">Basically instead of running at 60% of your
capacity, you bump it to 90%.</text><text start="321.628" dur="3.632">This also adds variety and actually helps
make the activity more fun, because you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="325.26" dur="2.72">not doing the same thing every single time.</text><text start="327.98" dur="2.97">Thirdly, doing it for longer periods simply means spending</text><text start="330.95" dur="2.778">more time on it, whenever you decide to do it.</text><text start="333.728" dur="5.232">So if you usually go for a 20 minute run,
you now try to do it for 30 minutes instead.</text><text start="338.96" dur="4.728">Basically you push yourself and persevere
through it just a little longer than you normally do.</text><text start="343.688" dur="1.582">Simple as that.</text><text start="345.27" dur="3.783">And all of this can be applied to pretty much
any activity.</text><text start="349.053" dur="1.527">Learning a new language?</text><text start="350.58" dur="4.79">Do it daily, maybe even multiple times a day
if possible; increase the time you spend learning</text><text start="355.37" dur="5.63">by 15 minutes, and use active recall along
with spaced repetition to remember more.</text><text start="361" dur="1.996">Trying to improve your social skills?</text><text start="362.996" dur="4.844">Consistently put yourself into environments
where social situations might occur, try saying</text><text start="367.84" dur="5.273">an extra sentence each time you find yourself
in one, and be the one who invites people out.</text><text start="373.113" dur="4.177">All of those 3 methods are a good way to move
from comfort towards growth, but depending</text><text start="377.29" dur="3.5">on the area you&amp;#39;re working on, some of them
are more useful.</text><text start="380.79" dur="3.65">For example, if you&amp;#39;re trying to learn an
instrument, you will find that it&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="384.44" dur="4.943">better to play every day for 10 minutes, than
it is to play once a week for 1 intense hour.</text><text start="389.383" dur="5.617">Also you shouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily use all 3 methods
at the same time, or it might be too much, too fast.</text><text start="395" dur="3.77">Instead you want to pick 1 and once you&amp;#39;re
ready, expand from there.</text><text start="398.77" dur="2.798">But more on that later.</text><text start="401.568" dur="4.441">Now as I mentioned, most of the gains in life
come from short term discomfort.</text><text start="406.009" dur="4.751">With that being said, if something is difficult,
it doesn&amp;#39;t automatically mean it&amp;#39;s good.</text><text start="410.76" dur="3.89">Breaking your leg might be uncomfortable,
but I don&amp;#39;t know of any positive results that</text><text start="414.65" dur="1.73">might have in the long term.</text><text start="416.38" dur="4.95">The area you want to be uncomfortable in,
has to have some sort of a long-term benefit.</text><text start="421.33" dur="3.84">Studying something, for example, makes you
feel stupid in the moment, but because you</text><text start="425.17" dur="3.275">absorb new concepts you get smarter over time.</text><text start="428.445" dur="4.495">Eating healthily and resisting sugar might
be difficult, but it is what allows you to</text><text start="432.94" dur="2.998">get in, and stay in good physical condition.</text><text start="435.938" dur="4.212">Saving money instead of splurging on a new
pair of shoes might be hard, but if invested</text><text start="440.15" dur="3.688">properly and given enough time, it will make
you wealthier.</text><text start="443.838" dur="3.417">So these types of areas are where you should
actually push yourself.</text><text start="447.255" dur="3.768">The ones with short-term pain, but long-term
gain.</text><text start="451.023" dur="3.977">And that is the second reason why I try to
do something difficult every day.</text><text start="455" dur="3.71">Even though it might feel uncomfortable in
the moment, I know that my behavior will pay</text><text start="458.71" dur="1.29">off in the future.</text><text start="460" dur="4.8">And only by entering the growth zone and pushing
myself, am I able to reap those positive long</text><text start="464.8" dur="2.23">term benefits.</text><text start="467.03" dur="5.628">Ok then, so why don&amp;#39;t more of us leave the
comfort zone if it&amp;#39;s clearly beneficial to do so?</text><text start="472.658" dur="2.835">Well that&amp;#39;s because there&amp;#39;s actually a third zone.</text><text start="475.493" dur="4.007">If someone were to push themselves too far
out of their comfort zone, they just might</text><text start="479.5" dur="3.8">pass the growth zone and go straight into
the danger zone.</text><text start="483.3" dur="3.07">This is why we feel uncomfortable in the first
place.</text><text start="486.37" dur="2.61">There is such a thing as pushing yourself
too far.</text><text start="488.98" dur="3.848">After all, if you exercise too much, you might
suffer an injury.</text><text start="492.828" dur="3.09">If you work too much, you might experience
burnout.</text><text start="495.918" dur="4.602">And discomfort is actually a very useful alarm,
preventing you from getting hurt, as such</text><text start="500.52" dur="2.918">an injury would likely set you further back.</text><text start="503.438" dur="3.582">So it makes perfect sense why most people
stay in their comfort zones.</text><text start="507.02" dur="2.98">They want to avoid the danger zone at all
costs.</text><text start="510" dur="4.287">But unfortunately, a lot of people, when they&amp;#39;re
looking to make a positive change in their life,</text><text start="514.287" dur="2.398">go straight into the danger zone.</text><text start="516.685" dur="1.865">One of my friends is like this.</text><text start="518.55" dur="3.028">A few years ago he wanted to improve his 
physical health.</text><text start="521.578" dur="4.201">With newfound motivation, he joined the gym
and made a commitment to lift weights five</text><text start="525.779" dur="1.133">times a week.</text><text start="526.912" dur="4.524">He also vowed to start a strict diet where
he would reduce his caloric intake</text><text start="531.436" dur="1.523">and cut out all sugar.</text><text start="532.959" dur="4.101">But within 1 month, he was back to routinely
sitting on the couch, watching Netflix and</text><text start="537.06" dur="1.985">stuffing himself with cookies.</text><text start="539.045" dur="3.31">Like most people, he took on too much, too
quickly.</text><text start="542.355" dur="3.945">And this is a very common occurrence when
trying to leave the comfort zone.</text><text start="546.3" dur="3.7">However, failing to stick to a plan isn&amp;#39;t
even the worst part.</text><text start="550" dur="3.72">The bigger issue people now have, is that
because they fail at keeping up with their</text><text start="553.72" dur="5.03">high expectations, they also feed their belief
that it&amp;#39;s entirely impossible for them to</text><text start="558.75" dur="1.25">change and grow.</text><text start="560" dur="4.204">Because of that they don&amp;#39;t even bother trying
to improve themselves in the future.</text><text start="564.204" dur="3.864">In their mind, they are failures who shouldn&amp;#39;t
try again.</text><text start="568.068" dur="2.052">So what&amp;#39;s the solution here?</text><text start="570.12" dur="4.459">How do we make getting out of the comfort
zone easier, so we can operate in the growth zone, </text><text start="574.579" dur="2.846">but at the same time, avoid the danger zone?</text><text start="577.425" dur="3.805">Positive change requires moving beyond our
comfort zone, yes.</text><text start="581.23" dur="3.06">However nowhere does it say all has to be
done at once.</text><text start="584.29" dur="5.48">A far more effective method is to go about
it gradually in small and manageable increments.</text><text start="589.77" dur="4.351">After all, if someone has been completely
sedentary and wants to begin exercising, it</text><text start="594.121" dur="4.621">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to start doing intense
weightlifting for two hours, five times a week.</text><text start="598.742" dur="4.128">Their odds of success are far higher if they
just begin with something they&amp;#39;re actually</text><text start="602.87" dur="1.53">capable of doing.</text><text start="604.4" dur="5.015">Like having a light gym session, 3 times a
week, for 45 minutes.</text><text start="609.415" dur="3.415">And only once they&amp;#39;re able to maintain that,
push further.</text><text start="612.83" dur="4.559">Remember, if you aren&amp;#39;t able to commit to
a small change, how can you expect to commit</text><text start="617.389" dur="1.493">to a big one?</text><text start="618.882" dur="2.322">Just something to think about.</text><text start="621.204" dur="5.899">Another benefit that comes from doing it gradually
is that you create a positive feedback loop.</text><text start="627.103" dur="3.726">Since you&amp;#39;re actually able to do what you
set out to do, you give yourself evidence</text><text start="630.829" dur="2.305">that you can indeed improve and change.</text><text start="633.134" dur="4.895">And this proof of progress, even if it&amp;#39;s small,
makes you feel really good and more confident</text><text start="638.029" dur="1.415">in your abilities.</text><text start="639.444" dur="4.716">This in turn fuels persistence to push through
more challenges further down the path.</text><text start="644.16" dur="5.54">Basically success starts to feed on itself and
you keep pushing further out of the comfort zone.</text><text start="649.7" dur="4.489">Also, when you get a positive feedback loop
going in one area, it tends to slowly spread</text><text start="654.189" dur="1.695">to other areas.</text><text start="655.884" dur="3.706">And this is the third reason why I try to
do something difficult every day.</text><text start="659.59" dur="4.645">Whenever I&amp;#39;m able to do something outside
my comfort zone, even if it&amp;#39;s just by a little,</text><text start="664.235" dur="2.724">it kickstarts this positive feedback loop.</text><text start="666.959" dur="5.526">And just like falling dominos, success fuels
further success.</text><text start="672.485" dur="3.762">That being said, you shouldn&amp;#39;t push past your
comfort zone all the time.</text><text start="676.247" dur="4.332">When I say I do something difficult every
day, don&amp;#39;t mistake this for me trying to expand</text><text start="680.579" dur="2.915">in every single area, on a daily basis.</text><text start="683.494" dur="5.306">I might be pushing myself in one or two areas,
but during that time, I return back to the</text><text start="688.8" dur="2.084">comfort zone in other areas.</text><text start="690.884" dur="4.888">This allows me to maintain my current zone,
but also get sufficient rest and recovery.</text><text start="695.772" dur="3.162">Without rest, I would probably burnout.</text><text start="698.934" dur="2.366">Yes, over time you want to grow.</text><text start="701.3" dur="3.812">But you also want to give your comfort zone
time to catch up to the new demands.</text><text start="705.112" dur="3.826">This graph is a rough example of how I believe
it should look like.</text><text start="708.938" dur="3.07">First you expand your comfort zone, by doing
something difficult.</text><text start="712.008" dur="2.494">But you don&amp;#39;t keep expanding indefinitely.</text><text start="714.502" dur="4.877">Instead, when it starts feeling too overwhelming,
you lower the difficulty and retract only</text><text start="719.379" dur="3.033">slightly above what your comfort zone was
before.</text><text start="722.412" dur="3.688">This allows you to get used to the new layer,
and you let your comfort zone catch up to</text><text start="726.1" dur="3.064">your new demands, which prevents you from
burning out.</text><text start="729.164" dur="3.773">Only once you&amp;#39;ve adapted to the new demands
and you feel like you&amp;#39;re ready to improve again,</text><text start="732.937" dur="2.333">you push past your new comfort zone.</text><text start="735.27" dur="5.267">Just like before, once you feel like it&amp;#39;s too hard,
 you retract slightly above the previous point.</text><text start="740.537" dur="4.152">Essentially you&amp;#39;re consistently challenging
yourself, but also coming back for air when</text><text start="744.689" dur="1.39">it gets too difficult.</text><text start="746.079" dur="4.859">And you can repeat this process until you
reach the level you want to be at.</text><text start="750.938" dur="4.989">Another way to look at it, is to think about
the comfort zone as a place of temporary refuge,</text><text start="755.927" dur="3.17">but not a permanent residence.</text><text start="759.097" dur="5.41">As you can see, the point of this video isn&amp;#39;t
to overexert yourself until you can&amp;#39;t go any further.</text><text start="764.507" dur="3.88">Rather, I&amp;#39;m trying to convince you to find
a worthy challenge, in hopes of bettering</text><text start="768.387" dur="2.262">yourself at things you care about.</text><text start="770.649" dur="4.351">Unfortunately, a lot of people give up at
the first taste of failure or discomfort,</text><text start="775" dur="2.595">and they never see what they&amp;#39;re actually capable of.</text><text start="777.595" dur="4.298">If you never push yourself to the limit, how
can you know where your limit is?</text><text start="781.893" dur="4.149">Only those who consistently push past their

dur="4.801">yeah thanks for having me as always</text><text start="83.28" dur="3.92">so we heard a clip from mark zuckerberg</text><text start="85.92" dur="3.199">talking about the company you know</text><text start="87.2" dur="3.68">wanting to focus on their discovery</text><text start="89.119" dur="3.841">engine and reels you know those changes</text><text start="90.88" dur="4.8">to the platforms but also their ad</text><text start="92.96" dur="4.64">infrastructure and the metaverse so</text><text start="95.68" dur="3.84">lay this out for us what kind of</text><text start="97.6" dur="4">situation has the company found itself</text><text start="99.52" dur="3.52">in and why are these the areas that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="101.6" dur="5.04">focusing on</text><text start="103.04" dur="6.32">so meta is basically in a position that</text><text start="106.64" dur="5.759">it has been in twice before in its</text><text start="109.36" dur="6.079">history and that is that it is having to</text><text start="112.399" dur="5.201">basically reinvent and very much pivot</text><text start="115.439" dur="4.64">its company for the sake of going</text><text start="117.6" dur="4.96">through you know an existential threat</text><text start="120.079" dur="4.161">we saw it in 2012 when the company was</text><text start="122.56" dur="4.159">getting ready to ipo</text><text start="124.24" dur="4.159">at that time social media was very much</text><text start="126.719" dur="5.361">shifting from being</text><text start="128.399" dur="4.961">web-based desktop-based to mobile first</text><text start="132.08" dur="3.84">and the company</text><text start="133.36" dur="4.48">really had to revamp its mobile apps and</text><text start="135.92" dur="4.48">spend a billion dollars acquiring</text><text start="137.84" dur="5.119">instagram we saw it again in the period</text><text start="140.4" dur="4.32">between 2016 and 2018</text><text start="142.959" dur="4.481">when they had to</text><text start="144.72" dur="4.4">essentially copy snapchat&amp;#39;s signature</text><text start="147.44" dur="3.6">feature stories</text><text start="149.12" dur="4">and they launched that on instagram and</text><text start="151.04" dur="4.559">later the rest of their apps and after</text><text start="153.12" dur="4.32">that they had to monetize that feature</text><text start="155.599" dur="3.841">to really just kind of</text><text start="157.44" dur="4.56">go to where the puck was going</text><text start="159.44" dur="4.64">and now we&amp;#39;re seeing it happen yet again</text><text start="162" dur="4.8">and this time it&amp;#39;s with tick tock and</text><text start="164.08" dur="4.96">with short form video but on top of all</text><text start="166.8" dur="4.64">that the company is also dealing with a</text><text start="169.04" dur="4.4">number of other macroeconomic factors</text><text start="171.44" dur="4.799">that are making the situation</text><text start="173.44" dur="4.32">much more difficult that of course being</text><text start="176.239" dur="4.401">inflation</text><text start="177.76" dur="5.52">you know the impact of apple&amp;#39;s privacy</text><text start="180.64" dur="5.04">changes to facebook&amp;#39;s advertising</text><text start="183.28" dur="4.16">business you know the looming recession</text><text start="185.68" dur="3.919">all those things are creating a really</text><text start="187.44" dur="4.799">difficult you can even call it a perfect</text><text start="189.599" dur="4.56">storm type situation for meta</text><text start="192.239" dur="3.28">so how is meta saying it&amp;#39;s dealing with</text><text start="194.159" dur="3.44">these challenges</text><text start="195.519" dur="4.321">yeah so it&amp;#39;s trying to do a number of</text><text start="197.599" dur="5.201">things to overcome this</text><text start="199.84" dur="4.88">it&amp;#39;s long-term solution is to</text><text start="202.8" dur="3.6">build out the metaverse which is really</text><text start="204.72" dur="3.599">just a buzzword for</text><text start="206.4" dur="3.52">virtual reality this is something that</text><text start="208.319" dur="3.761">they&amp;#39;ve been working on for a while and</text><text start="209.92" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s a key priority for them they want</text><text start="212.08" dur="6">people to have vr headsets and use that</text><text start="215.36" dur="4.72">as one of their main forms of computing</text><text start="218.08" dur="4.079">the reason for that is because</text><text start="220.08" dur="4.32">what meta lacks is its own hardware</text><text start="222.159" dur="4.321">device and when you don&amp;#39;t have that as a</text><text start="224.4" dur="4.559">tech company you&amp;#39;re always at the mercy</text><text start="226.48" dur="4.8">of someone else so they really want</text><text start="228.959" dur="4.801">virtual reality to take off and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="231.28" dur="5.12">their solution for the long term in the</text><text start="233.76" dur="5.199">short term they still need to get their</text><text start="236.4" dur="5.199">advertising business back in order and</text><text start="238.959" dur="6.161">they need to ensure that they don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="241.599" dur="6.401">lose users to tick-tock so what they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="245.12" dur="4.479">doing is essentially building out reels</text><text start="248" dur="2.879">which is essentially their version of</text><text start="249.599" dur="2.961">tick-tock</text><text start="250.879" dur="4.72">and not only are they building it out</text><text start="252.56" dur="5.04">but they&amp;#39;re really emphasizing it</text><text start="255.599" dur="4.081">yeah let&amp;#39;s talk about that a bit because</text><text start="257.6" dur="3.68">adam moseri the head of instagram</text><text start="259.68" dur="4.079">addressed some of the complaints about</text><text start="261.28" dur="4">changes the platform has made recently</text><text start="263.759" dur="3.921">including the increasing number of</text><text start="265.28" dur="4.479">videos and changing the kinds of posts</text><text start="267.68" dur="4.64">that users see he addressed this in a</text><text start="269.759" dur="4">video on tuesday let&amp;#39;s take a listen</text><text start="272.32" dur="3.439">now i want to be clear we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="273.759" dur="4.16">continue to support photos it&amp;#39;s part of</text><text start="275.759" dur="3.841">our heritage i love photos i know a lot</text><text start="277.919" dur="3.921">of you out there love photos too that</text><text start="279.6" dur="3.68">said i need to be honest i do believe</text><text start="281.84" dur="3.359">that more and more of instagram is going</text><text start="283.28" dur="4.32">to become video over time</text><text start="285.199" dur="5.041">so that video was posted on tuesday</text><text start="287.6" dur="4.4">flash forward to thursday and missouri</text><text start="290.24" dur="3.6">is saying the company is walking back</text><text start="292" dur="4.4">some of those changes what did he</text><text start="293.84" dur="5.04">announce yeah so missouri in an</text><text start="296.4" dur="5.04">interview that was published on thursday</text><text start="298.88" dur="4.4">with platformer he said that the company</text><text start="301.44" dur="4.08">is actually going to roll back and</text><text start="303.28" dur="4.4">rethink some of these changes</text><text start="305.52" dur="4.32">the two that are getting rolled back is</text><text start="307.68" dur="3.84">a redesign that was being tested where</text><text start="309.84" dur="4.32">users were going to see photos and</text><text start="311.52" dur="4.88">videos in full screen so very similar to</text><text start="314.16" dur="4.479">the design of tick tock and the other</text><text start="316.4" dur="5.04">thing that is going to be rolled back to</text><text start="318.639" dur="4.481">a certain extent is the number of posts</text><text start="321.44" dur="3.599">that users see</text><text start="323.12" dur="4.56">based on ai recommendations from</text><text start="325.039" dur="4.241">accounts that they don&amp;#39;t already follow</text><text start="327.68" dur="3.84">so these were two of the biggest changes</text><text start="329.28" dur="4.32">that they had announced this year and it</text><text start="331.52" dur="5.04">seems like instagram is really</text><text start="333.6" dur="5.12">rethinking just how much it can throw at</text><text start="336.56" dur="5.04">its users all at once</text><text start="338.72" dur="4.72">but what was made clear by misery in</text><text start="341.6" dur="4.96">this interview with platformer is that</text><text start="343.44" dur="5.28">these rollbacks are only temporary so</text><text start="346.56" dur="4.88">instagram users should still expect that</text><text start="348.72" dur="4.4">these changes will come down at some</text><text start="351.44" dur="3.36">point down the road</text><text start="353.12" dur="4">what does this mean in terms of their</text><text start="354.8" dur="4.88">efforts to get the the creator economy</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.639">and we heard you know some famous people</text><text start="359.68" dur="4.32">kylie jenner kim kardashian say they</text><text start="361.759" dur="4.72">they didn&amp;#39;t like the changes that were</text><text start="364" dur="5.44">being implemented how do we expect that</text><text start="366.479" dur="4.641">to to impact instagram&amp;#39;s decisions</text><text start="369.44" dur="3.52">yeah well in this interview that</text><text start="371.12" dur="4.32">missouri did with platformer he very</text><text start="372.96" dur="5.04">much addressed creators and talked about</text><text start="375.44" dur="5.039">how creators expect something stable you</text><text start="378" dur="4.96">know if they&amp;#39;re gonna make your platform</text><text start="380.479" dur="5.521">their livelihood they need to understand</text><text start="382.96" dur="5.04">how it works have an understanding or an</text><text start="386" dur="4.24">expectation of which of their posts will</text><text start="388" dur="5.12">succeed and therefore be able to make an</text><text start="390.24" dur="4.88">income from this my favorite quote from</text><text start="393.12" dur="4.4">his interview with platformer</text><text start="395.12" dur="4">he said change is hard i also want to</text><text start="397.52" dur="3.2">acknowledge if you spend an hour at your</text><text start="399.12" dur="3.28">desk every day talking to your friends</text><text start="400.72" dur="3.919">and reading or watching tv and then i</text><text start="402.4" dur="4.079">come by and i just rearranged everything</text><text start="404.639" dur="3.761">without telling you you&amp;#39;d be pretty</text><text start="406.479" dur="3.921">pissed so i think we need to do a better</text><text start="408.4" dur="3.519">job making sure it&amp;#39;s clear why something</text><text start="410.4" dur="4.32">is better in explaining something before</text><text start="411.919" dur="4.56">it happens so we don&amp;#39;t surprise people</text><text start="414.72" dur="4.319">and i think that tells you everything</text><text start="416.479" dur="4.881">that you need to know where missouri and</text><text start="419.039" dur="4.801">the rest of meta they have so many</text><text start="421.36" dur="4.959">stakeholders that they need to answer to</text><text start="423.84" dur="5.04">whether it&amp;#39;s your everyday user</text><text start="426.319" dur="5.361">you know creators or</text><text start="428.88" dur="5.84">trying to attract younger users who are</text><text start="431.68" dur="5.04">going off to tick tock and that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="434.72" dur="4.08">problem when your user base gets as big</text><text start="436.72" dur="4.479">as it is you have a lot of people that</text><text start="438.8" dur="4.64">you need to make happy and it&amp;#39;s you know</text><text start="441.199" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very hard to do that</text><text start="443.44" dur="3.52">all right that&amp;#39;s our

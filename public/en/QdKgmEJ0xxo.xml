section of a department store knows, there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="5.06" dur="4.38">a clear pattern to what colors of clothes
are usually available for boys and girls.</text><text start="9.44" dur="4.17">Yep, that&amp;#39;d be pink and blue, a distinction
that&amp;#39;s become such a tradition for dressing</text><text start="13.61" dur="4.84">up those little ones that it&amp;#39;s often tough
to find anything but the two basic hues.</text><text start="18.45" dur="3.6">But it wasn&amp;#39;t always that way, and if you
do some digging into the history of how we</text><text start="22.05" dur="4.38">identify our children, you&amp;#39;ll find that there&amp;#39;s
a lot that went into making the blue-pink</text><text start="26.43" dur="3.2">dynamic such a mainstay of kids&amp;#39; fashions.</text><text start="29.63" dur="1.87">Plain white tease</text><text start="31.5" dur="4.329">Long before society latched onto these two
colors, it was gender-neutral colors that</text><text start="35.829" dur="2.381">gained favor with American families.</text><text start="38.21" dur="4.39">For practical reasons, it was just easier
for families to bleach soiled clothing items</text><text start="42.6" dur="4.54">if they were simply made with all-white fabrics,
&amp;#39;cause, you know, stuff happens...</text><text start="47.14" dur="1">&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s making poop face&amp;quot;</text><text start="48.14" dur="1">&amp;quot;What do you mean she&amp;#39;s making the poop face?&amp;quot;</text><text start="49.14" dur="1">&amp;quot;Oh my god she&amp;#39;s gonna poop in the tub.</text><text start="50.14" dur="2.64">Hurry up, hurry up, she&amp;#39;s gonna poop on me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="52.78" dur="1.57">&amp;quot;No that&amp;#39;s my hat.&amp;quot;</text><text start="54.35" dur="3.949">So white was really the preferred color for
young kids to wear until they reached the</text><text start="58.299" dur="4.4">age of six or seven and started wearing more
sophisticated and colorful threads like the</text><text start="62.699" dur="1.911">adults in their lives.</text><text start="64.61" dur="2.21">Vice versa</text><text start="66.82" dur="3.95">According to fashion historians, the idea
of associating pastel colors with children</text><text start="70.77" dur="4.67">occurred around the middle of the 19th century,
and it would take another seven decades before</text><text start="75.44" dur="2.62">specific colors were assigned to each gender.</text><text start="78.06" dur="4.69">But even then things were still quite different,
as some publications deemed pink the ideal</text><text start="82.75" dur="5.409">color for boys since it was a stronger, bolder
color, while blue was better suited for girls.</text><text start="88.159" dur="4.21">While some forward-thinkers from the era also
suggested perhaps each baby should be dressed</text><text start="92.369" dur="4.951">according to his or her own features, like,
say, eye color, the common gender association</text><text start="97.32" dur="3.21">of clothing colors was still beginning to
take shape.</text><text start="100.53" dur="1.629">The first pink-blue divide</text><text start="102.159" dur="5.6">By the 1940s and the end of World War II,
the gender-specific clothing trend was firmly</text><text start="107.759" dur="4.301">entrenched in the public consciousness for
as simple a reason as that&amp;#39;s what retailers</text><text start="112.06" dur="1.059">were pushing.</text><text start="113.119" dur="3.96">Rosie the Riveter might&amp;#39;ve been wearing blue,
but once her man came back from the front</text><text start="117.079" dur="4.86">lines, she could trade in her oil-stained
blues for the flowery pink aprons that became</text><text start="121.939" dur="1.411">her kitchen uniform.</text><text start="123.35" dur="4.969">By 1947, fashion designers like Christian
Dior were advertising the clothing of the</text><text start="128.319" dur="1.761">postwar ideal.</text><text start="130.08" dur="1.2">And for women?</text><text start="131.28" dur="4.43">There was a ton of soft, flowing, now-feminine
pink.</text><text start="135.71" dur="4.42">From there, we came to firmly believe that
pink was the color for girls, while blue was</text><text start="140.13" dur="3.82">the color of snips, snails, and puppy dog
tails.</text><text start="143.95" dur="2.03">Breaking with tradition</text><text start="145.98" dur="5.05">The emergence of the women&amp;#39;s liberation movement
kick-started the social change of the 1960s,</text><text start="151.03" dur="4.09">which put a temporary end to the dominance
of gender-specific colors.</text><text start="155.12" dur="5.32">The idea that dressing girls in pink was going
to encourage kitchen conformity gained favor,</text><text start="160.44" dur="4.75">and thus began the argument that there was
no biological reason for girls to favor pink</text><text start="165.19" dur="1.52">over blue.</text><text start="166.71" dur="4.12">&amp;quot;Ooh delicious, stupid cookieâ€¦&amp;quot;</text><text start="170.83" dur="1.58">&amp;#39;80s backtrack</text><text start="172.41" dur="3.54">Of course, what goes up must come down.</text><text start="175.95" dur="4.51">A re-emergence of &amp;quot;blue is for boys, pink
is for girls&amp;quot; fashion ethos for our pint-sized</text><text start="180.46" dur="5.08">citizens in the &amp;#39;80s had a lot to do with
the most powerful thing in the world: money.</text><text start="185.54" dur="4.47">Finding out the gender of babies before they
were born suddenly became a medical possibility,</text><text start="190.01" dur="4.43">and that meant retailers found a new way to
capitalize on selling specific merchandise</text><text start="194.44" dur="1.57">geared toward boys and girls.</text><text start="196.01" dur="4.53">Given how many couples have more than one
child and how many families have both sons</text><text start="200.54" dur="4.75">and daughters, that made hand-me-downs more
difficult if dressing your second-born daughter</text><text start="205.29" dur="3.9">in your first-born son&amp;#39;s clothes is going
against social norms.</text><text start="209.19" dur="4.57">The feisty resistance to clothing-based gender
association died down a bit by then.</text><text start="213.76" dur="4.19">The trend of dressing little Suzie in pink
while Scotty wore his light blue was back</text><text start="217.95" dur="1.38">in style.</text><text start="219.33" dur="4.01">&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a harsh world.&amp;quot;</text><text start="223.34" dur="1.69">Modern times?</text><text start="225.03" dur="4.52">Fast-forward a few decades, and we&amp;#39;re still
seeing those familiar tones everywhere in</text><text start="229.55" dur="1.37">kids&amp;#39; clothing aisles.</text><text start="230.92" dur="1.89">&amp;quot;On Wednesdays we wear pink.&amp;quot;</text><text start="232.81" dur="4.15">Recent gender studies have tried to get to
the bottom of just why this is still a thing,</text><text start="236.96" dur="2.54">but it&amp;#39;s something of a chicken-or-the-egg
scenario.</text><text start="239.5" dur="3.08">Do we assign these colors to each gender because
that&amp;#39;s what they like?</text><text start="242.58" dur="3.71">Or do they gravitate toward these colors because
that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re dressed in, and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="246.29" dur="1.65">what they see their peers doing?</text><text start="247.94" dur="5.29">One 2011 study offered babies the choice between
two nearly identical objects.</text><text start="253.23" dur="1.91">One was pink, the other wasn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="255.14" dur="4.021">When they were a year old, there was no difference
in the number that would choose pink or the</text><text start="259.161" dur="1.019">other color.</text><text start="260.18" dur="3.66">By the time they were two years old, many
more girls were choosing pink.</text><text start="263.84" dur="4.57">By four, the gender divide was evident on
both sides, with most boys now refusing the</text><text start="268.41" dur="1.15">pink item.</text><text start="269.56" dur="1.44">Noticing a pattern here?</text><text start="271" dur="4.061">It&amp;#39;s still hard to hone in on what exactly
inspires that pigment preference, but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="275.061" dur="3.789">clearly something that&amp;#39;s learned along the
way.</text><text start="278.85" dur="1.74">All grown up</text><text start="280.59" dur="4.15">If it&amp;#39;s true that kids feel pressured to like
pink or blue based on the gender norms they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="284.74" dur="3.75">exposed to, the same doesn&amp;#39;t exactly hold
true in adulthood.</text><text start="288.49" dur="4.94">In 2012, a sociological study at the University
of Maryland showed that when two-thousand</text><text start="293.43" dur="4.33">people were asked to choose a favorite color
between blue, pink, and a handful of other</text><text start="297.76" dur="4.31">options, the overwhelming majority from both
genders chose blue.</text><text start="302.07" dur="3.76">While very few of the men chose pink as their
primary pick from the spectrum, there were</text><text start="305.83" dur="2.14">also few women who did so.</text><text start="307.97" dur="4.49">In other words, once we reach an age of maturity,
that strong sense of devotion to pink might</text><text start="312.46" dur="4.41">dissipate with women, who gravitate towards
favoring blue just like the fellas.</text><text start="316.87" dur="1.39">Thanks for watching!</text><text start="318.26" dur="2.98">Click the The List icon to subscribe to our

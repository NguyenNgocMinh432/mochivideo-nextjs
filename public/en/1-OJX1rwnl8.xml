ordered something at Starbucks,</text><text start="6.55" dur="2.12">you&amp;#39;ve probably loaded one of these.</text><text start="8.67" dur="2.15">- Starbucks, between October and December</text><text start="10.82" dur="2.85">has had something like $3 billion of value</text><text start="13.67" dur="1.6">is loaded onto these cards.</text><text start="15.27" dur="1.39">I mean, that&amp;#39;s a lot of money.</text><text start="16.66" dur="1.4">- [Narrator] So much money in fact,</text><text start="18.06" dur="1.9">that if Starbucks was a bank,</text><text start="19.96" dur="4.05">it would rank as the 385th
biggest in the country.</text><text start="24.01" dur="3.29">And it&amp;#39;s money that Starbucks
gets to use upfront as revenue</text><text start="27.3" dur="2.99">before a single product is even purchased.</text><text start="30.29" dur="3.65">- Eventually it is a liability
if someone chooses to use it,</text><text start="33.94" dur="1.38">and you will find that</text><text start="35.32" dur="1.66">in lots of gift card programs,</text><text start="36.98" dur="1.75">they&amp;#39;re plenty of people who never use it.</text><text start="38.73" dur="3.07">- [Narrator] So how important
is Starbucks&amp;#39; mobile app</text><text start="41.8" dur="2.15">and gift cards to its bottom line?</text><text start="43.95" dur="2.6">And what role does technology play</text><text start="46.55" dur="2.59">in its continued evolution?</text><text start="49.14" dur="3.453">This is the economics of Starbucks.</text><text start="53.43" dur="2.79">In 1971, the first Starbucks,</text><text start="56.22" dur="4.05">a small unassuming cafe
opened in Seattle&amp;#39;s downtown.</text><text start="60.27" dur="3.49">Fast forward 50 years, and that
store is still in operation,</text><text start="63.76" dur="2.81">but Starbucks is a global coffee giant.</text><text start="66.57" dur="2.7">- Only McDonald&amp;#39;s is bigger than Starbucks</text><text start="69.27" dur="1.7">when it comes to market caps.</text><text start="70.97" dur="2.46">So they are really a powerhouse</text><text start="73.43" dur="2.752">when it comes to really the
whole restaurant industry.</text><text start="76.182" dur="2.218">- [Narrator] In its
early years of operation</text><text start="78.4" dur="3.43">Starbucks expanded slowly
and only within Seattle.</text><text start="81.83" dur="3.13">It wasn&amp;#39;t until 1987
when the original owners</text><text start="84.96" dur="2.68">sold the company to its
then marketing director,</text><text start="87.64" dur="0.93">Howard Schultz,</text><text start="88.57" dur="2.61">that the Starbucks that
we know today took root.</text><text start="91.18" dur="2.88">Schultz began expanding
Starbucks outside of the city</text><text start="94.06" dur="2.86">and introduced Americans to
what was then a little known</text><text start="96.92" dur="2.7">Italian drink, the espresso.</text><text start="99.62" dur="2.66">- They were really founded
on this coffee house culture</text><text start="102.28" dur="4.97">that they make each beverage
by hand according to order.</text><text start="107.25" dur="1.37">As Starbucks has grown,</text><text start="108.62" dur="2.19">that has gotten more complicated.</text><text start="110.81" dur="2.17">- [Narrator] Today, Starbucks
says they make more than</text><text start="112.98" dur="3.29">a 170,000 different varieties of drinks.</text><text start="116.27" dur="1.97">- These beverages can be very complex.</text><text start="118.24" dur="1.03">They can take a while.</text><text start="119.27" dur="2.19">They can take many different ingredients.</text><text start="121.46" dur="1.94">And so it&amp;#39;s good for Starbucks.</text><text start="123.4" dur="2.87">And that these tend to be
higher price beverages,</text><text start="126.27" dur="4.51">but for workers, the baristas,
they can be very complicated.</text><text start="130.78" dur="2.41">- [Narrator] The company&amp;#39;s
early investment in espresso</text><text start="133.19" dur="2.84">has transformed to many
different signature drinks</text><text start="136.03" dur="2.13">from the creation of the frappucino</text><text start="138.16" dur="2.31">to the launch with a pumpkin spice latte.</text><text start="140.47" dur="3.71">- Pumpkin spice latte, high five it.</text><text start="144.18" dur="0.88">- They really didn&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="145.06" dur="1.44">that it would take off like it did,</text><text start="146.5" dur="2.87">but clearly it is formed
quite a phenomenon</text><text start="149.37" dur="2.43">all around the world really.</text><text start="151.8" dur="3.39">- We introduced pumpkin to
spice, us here, Starbucks.</text><text start="155.19" dur="3.05">- One additional thing
in Starbucks evolution is</text><text start="158.24" dur="3.07">cold beverages have
become much more important</text><text start="161.31" dur="2.23">to the company, whether
it&amp;#39;s just an iced coffee</text><text start="163.54" dur="2.35">or a nitro iced coffee,</text><text start="165.89" dur="2.92">or all these cold foam and cold brewed.</text><text start="168.81" dur="2.82">Increasingly this is so
important to their revenue,</text><text start="171.63" dur="2.78">the company has gone through
periods where frappuccino sales</text><text start="174.41" dur="2.419">have softened, but they&amp;#39;ve
come up with more cold drinks</text><text start="176.829" dur="3.261">to keep people interested
and keep people ordering.</text><text start="180.09" dur="2.66">- [Narrator] In part due to
the company&amp;#39;s Seattle founding</text><text start="182.75" dur="3.71">technology has played a large
role in the change dominance.</text><text start="186.46" dur="3.05">- A key moment of that was
the founding of its mobile app</text><text start="189.51" dur="2.36">in 2009, which was very early</text><text start="191.87" dur="1.16">for one of these kinds of apps.</text><text start="193.03" dur="3.62">And they really saw this
as a digital flywheel.</text><text start="196.65" dur="3.46">- At the end of 2021, mobile
orders accounted for nearly</text><text start="200.11" dur="3.51">a quarter of all Starbucks
transactions in the US.</text><text start="203.62" dur="1.14">Many of those purchased</text><text start="204.76" dur="2.33">through a virtual Starbucks gift card,</text><text start="207.09" dur="2.05">which was previously the only way</text><text start="209.14" dur="2.2">a customer could order on their phone.</text><text start="211.34" dur="4.36">Today, a little under one half
or 44% of all transactions</text><text start="215.7" dur="2.61">at Starbucks are done
with a Starbucks card.</text><text start="218.31" dur="3.22">In fact, so many Starbucks
customers use a Starbucks card</text><text start="221.53" dur="2.53">or the Starbucks mobile
app to purchase items</text><text start="224.06" dur="4.01">that Starbucks says it holds
about $2.4 billion in cash</text><text start="228.07" dur="2.87">that was uploaded by
customers to be used later.</text><text start="230.94" dur="4.29">That number exceeds the
deposits at many American banks.</text><text start="235.23" dur="2.2">- Starbucks also gets a
lot of data from that.</text><text start="237.43" dur="4.03">They own a lot of that data
in a way that many companies</text><text start="241.46" dur="2.66">don&amp;#39;t because they have
created this whole ecosystem</text><text start="244.12" dur="2.84">where people are using the Starbucks app,</text><text start="246.96" dur="3.04">they&amp;#39;re mobile ordering,
and they&amp;#39;re hooked into that</text><text start="250" dur="2.44">Starbucks unique proprietary system.</text><text start="252.44" dur="1.67">- [Narrator] As mobile payments rise,</text><text start="254.11" dur="2.98">Starbucks&amp;#39; business
priorities have shifted.</text><text start="257.09" dur="3.591">Prior to the pandemic,
approximately 80% of US Starbucks</text><text start="260.681" dur="2.229">transactions were on the go,</text><text start="262.91" dur="3.17">either as drive-through or mobile order.</text><text start="266.08" dur="1.81">- Starbucks started in cities,</text><text start="267.89" dur="2.79">but really has spread
all around the country,</text><text start="270.68" dur="1.43">including the suburbs.</text><text start="272.11" dur="1.97">And a lot of that is through drive-thrus.</text><text start="274.08" dur="1.84">- [Narrator] These
alternate pickup options</text><text start="275.92" dur="2.09">are becoming increasingly important</text><text start="278.01" dur="1.71">to the company&amp;#39;s bottom line.</text><text start="279.72" dur="1.43">- [Woman] Especially during the pandemic.</text><text start="281.15" dur="2.91">I mean, these stores have
been a lifeline to Starbucks</text><text start="284.06" dur="3.06">because they kept running and
people could easily queue up</text><text start="287.12" dur="3.13">and go and not have to
enter an actual cafe.</text><text start="290.25" dur="1.717">- [Narrator] Starbucks has long said that</text><text start="291.967" dur="2.133">&amp;quot;It remains committed to a set of values</text><text start="294.1" dur="2.57">established early in the
company&amp;#39;s existence.&amp;quot;</text><text start="296.67" dur="3.65">- Starbucks is very
committed to trying to create</text><text start="300.32" dur="2.956">a connection between its
baristas and its customers,</text><text start="303.276" dur="1.764">even in its drive-thru.</text><text start="305.04" dur="1.7">They talk about this on earnings calls</text><text start="306.74" dur="2.77">that there are these
customer connection scores.</text><text start="309.51" dur="2.74">They want to make sure that
everyone is feeling good</text><text start="312.25" dur="1.4">about their Starbucks experience,</text><text start="313.65" dur="2.23">which is getting increasingly challenging</text><text start="315.88" dur="2.9">when you&amp;#39;re ordering through
a drive-thru or a mobile app.</text><text start="318.78" dur="1.53">You&amp;#39;re trying to get in and out.</text><text start="320.31" dur="2.82">- [Narrator] Starbucks says,
&amp;quot;Those values also appear</text><text start="323.13" dur="2.93">in the manner in which
their stores are designed.&amp;quot;</text><text start="326.06" dur="1.96">- The items you will find in the store,</text><text start="328.02" dur="3.49">they really choreograph that
down to where the basket</text><text start="331.51" dur="1.76">of water is placed into a store.</text><text start="333.27" dur="2.18">They want this all to feel very similar.</text><text start="335.45" dur="3.07">- [Narrator] Starbucks has long
touted its internal culture,</text><text start="338.52" dur="2.87">which it says is built
on a strong relationship</text><text start="341.39" dur="2.4">between management and employees.</text><text start="343.79" dur="3.33">- The workers at it&amp;#39;s stores
are not called workers</text><text start="347.12" dur="1.79">or baristas they are called partners.</text><text start="348.91" dur="3.97">And this is very central
to the company&amp;#39;s ideology.</text><text start="352.88" dur="2.44">Part of that is that all these partners</text><text start="355.32" dur="4.52">do get shares in the company,
it&amp;#39;s called Beanstalk.</text><text start="359.84" dur="1.58">- [Narrator] That relationship
may look different</text><text start="361.42" dur="2.65">going forward for some
Starbucks locations.</text><text start="364.07" dur="2.81">After two of three Buffalo stores voted</text><text start="366.88" dur="2.2">in favor of unionization.</text><text start="369.08" dur="1.76">- [Narrator] Since then,
Starbucks has thrown</text><text start="370.84" dur="4.06">a huge amount of energy and
resources into this issue.</text><text start="374.9" dur="4.43">And executives have traveled
to Buffalo extensively</text><text start="379.33" dur="2.977">to meet with workers, to try
to understand their concerns</text><text start="382.307" dur="1.706">(indistinct) to the company.</text><text start="384.98" dur="2.38">They want to maintain
this direct relationship</text><text start="387.36" dur="3.09">with their workers, they
call unions an intermediary.</text><text start="390.45" dur="3.41">They do not want that
relationship to be severed.</text><text start="393.86" dur="3.43">But according to these workers,
they who support the union,</text><text start="397.29" dur="2.81">they want a more direct
relationship with the company.</text><text start="400.1" dur="1.87">- [Narrator] In a statement
to the &amp;quot;Wall Street Journal&amp;quot;</text><text start="401.97" dur="3.51">Starbucks said, &amp;quot;Starbucks&amp;#39;s
success past, present,</text><text start="405.48" dur="3.15">and future is built on
how we partner together,</text><text start="408.63" dur="3.09">always with our mission
and values at our core.</text><text start="411.72" dur="2.2">From the beginning, we&amp;#39;ve
been clear in our belief</text><text start="413.92" dur="1.93">that we are better together as partners</text><text start="415.85" dur="2.117">without a union between us at Starbucks.</text><text start="417.967" dur="2.31">And that conviction has not changed.&amp;quot;</text><text start="421.41" dur="2.21">- They are the world&amp;#39;s
biggest coffee chain.</text><text start="423.62" dur="2.84">They are very dominant when
it comes to coffee sales,</text><text start="426.46" dur="3.67">and they are really synonymous
with the coffee house culture</text><text start="430.13" dur="3.557">in a lot of ways, but they
do face increasing pressures.</text><text start="433.687" dur="2.667">(upbeat music)</text></transcript>

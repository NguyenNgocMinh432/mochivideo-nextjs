good</text><text start="45.28" dur="4.24">for the planet</text><text start="46.64" dur="6.8">aviation contaminates the air</text><text start="49.52" dur="7.039">by producing co2 when they on planes fly</text><text start="53.44" dur="6.639">we don&amp;#39;t have electric planes yet so the</text><text start="56.559" dur="4.64">only solution we have is to get better</text><text start="60.079" dur="3.601">fuel</text><text start="61.199" dur="2.481">that&amp;#39;s it</text><text start="63.92" dur="6.96">this is why i came here to abu dhabi to</text><text start="67.28" dur="7.199">show you people who have a better fuel</text><text start="70.88" dur="6.559">it&amp;#39;s called sustainable aviation fuel</text><text start="74.479" dur="6.241">and it&amp;#39;s coming to a plane near you</text><text start="77.439" dur="7.281">this is how it works</text><text start="80.72" dur="7.12">itahad airways uses this piece of desert</text><text start="84.72" dur="5.52">land to grow plants</text><text start="87.84" dur="6.08">okay actually these plants are very</text><text start="90.24" dur="6.08">special because they grow in ocean salty</text><text start="93.92" dur="6">water they don&amp;#39;t need fresh water to</text><text start="96.32" dur="7.52">grow and on these plants there&amp;#39;s a lot</text><text start="99.92" dur="6.159">of seeds and these seeds are full of oil</text><text start="103.84" dur="5.12">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s unique about them</text><text start="106.079" dur="5.68">then they take the plant collect its</text><text start="108.96" dur="6.32">tiny seeds and crush them to become</text><text start="111.759" dur="6.32">vegetable oil this vegetable oil has so</text><text start="115.28" dur="6.08">much energy that you can turn it

fuel this fuel is new and promising</text><text start="133.2" dur="6.8">it works exactly like normal but it</text><text start="136.239" dur="6.961">reduces carbon emissions by 80 percent</text><text start="140" dur="6.4">in its life cycle it can be eighty</text><text start="143.2" dur="5.44">percent better some plants reduce the</text><text start="146.4" dur="4.88">carbon footprint by 30 percent some</text><text start="148.64" dur="4.8">others by 80 percent but when using</text><text start="151.28" dur="4.72">these types of plants that grow with</text><text start="153.44" dur="6.24">salt

dur="6">percent of flights use sustainable fuel</text><text start="166.64" dur="6.4">etihad airways did the first ever flight</text><text start="169.519" dur="6.881">in 2019 but they only did it a few times</text><text start="173.04" dur="6">since because fuel is expensive</text><text start="176.4" dur="5.119">the airline business is a small margin</text><text start="179.04" dur="3.919">business

for the next 10 20 30 years</text><text start="228.64" dur="5.679">and we need to change our ways and use a</text><text start="232.08" dur="4.719">fuel that is more sustainable</text><text

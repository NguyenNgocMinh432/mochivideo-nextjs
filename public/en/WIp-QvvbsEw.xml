Gorp from Planet 55MFB.</text><text start="6.84" dur="4.57">We want to buy your planet for all it’s
materials...and also maybe turn it into a</text><text start="11.41" dur="1">giant petting zoo.</text><text start="12.41" dur="3.5">We will provide your people with another planet
to live on... but we want Earth.</text><text start="15.91" dur="1.31">It has to be earth.</text><text start="17.22" dur="3.14">Give us your price today and we will pay it.”</text><text start="20.46" dur="0.5">Hmm?</text><text start="21.12" dur="1.84">This seems like a totally real scenario..</text><text start="23.5" dur="2.8">and i think society would be up for a change of scenery!</text><text start="26.3" dur="2.72">so...how Much Could We Sell The Earth For?”</text><text start="29.029" dur="4.351">A lot of things come into play in determining
the value of our planet, but if these aliens</text><text start="33.38" dur="4.77">want their answer today, we don’t have time
to go through every valuable resource on Earth.</text><text start="38.15" dur="2.86">So, we’re going to focus on some main ones.</text><text start="41.01" dur="1.29">Let’s start with our water.</text><text start="42.3" dur="4.47">Earth is the only known planet with liquid
water on its surface and we’d definitely</text><text start="46.77" dur="1.76">want to take advantage of that.</text><text start="48.53" dur="4.5">Aliens could use this as rocket fuel by splitting
it into hydrogen and oxygen, effectively allowing</text><text start="53.03" dur="4.71">them to turn Earth into an intergalactic gas
station, so let’s start with a price point</text><text start="57.74" dur="2.839">of $50 trillion for this resource.</text><text start="60.579" dur="4.65">Our planet is chocked full of valuable elements
that we’d want to include in our price for</text><text start="65.229" dur="1.041">the aliens.</text><text start="66.27" dur="5.12">Take gold for example - it’s impossible
to say exactly how much gold our planet holds,</text><text start="71.39" dur="5.85">but many experts believe we’ve already found
about 193,000 tons, which would be worth a</text><text start="77.24" dur="2.46">whopping $8 trillion dollars.</text><text start="79.7" dur="2.029">We’ve also got a lot of aluminum.</text><text start="81.729" dur="4.861">It makes up 8% of the Earth’s crust and
is used to fuel rocket boosters, which aliens</text><text start="86.59" dur="1.059">would prooobably need.</text><text start="87.649" dur="3.421">So, we’ll tack on $10 trillion for that.</text><text start="91.07" dur="5.009">We don’t know what they use for energy but
maybe they’d value our oil and coal reserves.</text><text start="96.079" dur="4.74">It’s hard to know exactly how much of these
the Earth has left but our available oil supply</text><text start="100.819" dur="6.601">is thought to be valued at about $109 trillion
and coal, $71 trillion.</text><text start="107.42" dur="4.589">These aliens may seem friendly but they’re
making a huge investment in our planet and</text><text start="112.009" dur="1.75">I imagine they’ll want to protect it.</text><text start="113.759" dur="5.78">Well, the 1,400 tons of highly-enriched uranium
believed to exist on Earth would probably</text><text start="119.539" dur="1">help.</text><text start="120.539" dur="1.78">This is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.</text><text start="122.319" dur="5.19">It’s incredibly valuable with the price
of one kilogram ranging from about $3 million</text><text start="127.509" dur="1.72">to $36 million!</text><text start="129.229" dur="5.631">This means Earth’s highly-enriched uranium
supply could be worth up to $46 trillion!</text><text start="134.86" dur="1.66">And we don’t want to leave out diamonds.</text><text start="136.52" dur="2.58">They could be an alien&amp;#39;s best friend too.</text><text start="139.1" dur="4.48">Figuring out the value of Earth’s diamonds
is especially difficult since one diamond’s</text><text start="143.58" dur="5.2">value depends on so many things, like cut,
color, carat and clarity but taking annual</text><text start="148.78" dur="5.58">diamond industry profits into account, let’s
factor in $3 trillion for our global diamond</text><text start="154.36" dur="1">supply.</text><text start="155.36" dur="1">At this point, we’re up to $294 trillion.</text><text start="156.36" dur="2.43">But if you think about the bigger picture,
what’s inside the Earth, all this surface</text><text start="158.79" dur="1.87">level stuff becomes irrelevant.</text><text start="160.66" dur="4.96">We did some digging, pun-intended, and found
that just the solid iron core of our planet</text><text start="165.62" dur="2.92">would be worth 4.8 sextillion dollars!</text><text start="168.54" dur="2.94">and yes, i said that correctly. Get your giggles out now.</text><text start="171.68" dur="4.18">Our planet is filled with various precious
metals and elements that would be worth a</text><text start="175.86" dur="1.42">crazy amount of money.</text><text start="177.28" dur="5.35">So I wouldn’t let this home planet of ours
go for anything less than 10 sextillion dollars!</text><text start="182.63" dur="5.05">I think that’s a pretty fair price tag for
a habitable planet with water, air and lots</text><text start="187.68" dur="1.48">of beautiful sights to see.</text><text start="189.16" dur="1.4">Don’t you, Triangle Bob?</text><text start="190.56" dur="4.37">Oh okay...he’s just trying to wear jars of peanut butter as shoes...</text><text start="194.93" dur="0.91">Never mind.</text><text start="195.84" dur="0.66">anyway</text><text start="196.72" dur="3.74">Would you go live on the other planet they’re
giving us or would you stay here?</text><text start="200.46" dur="2.2">and what should we name this new planet?</text><text start="202.8" dur="1.6">Let me know 
in the comment section below.</text><text start="204.4" dur="5.62">and if you&amp;#39;re curious to know how much space is actually worth, well then you should check out this video!</text><text start="210.02" dur="8.68">the total value of the moon&amp;#39;s resources has been estimated at between 150 and 500 quadrillion dollars.</text><text start="218.7" dur="1.54">yup...quadrillion.</text><text start="220.24" dur="2.56">as always
my name is Blocko.</text><text start="222.8" dur="3.68">this has been life noggin!
Don&amp;#39;t forget to keep on thinking!</text></transcript>

off your life.</text><text start="4.68" dur="2.44">This is News Review from
BBC Learning English.</text><text start="7.12" dur="1.8">I&amp;#39;m Neil. And I&amp;#39;m Beth.</text><text start="8.92" dur="3.36">And we have lots of language about
this story in today&amp;#39;s programme.</text><text start="12.28" dur="4.44">We do. And remember, subscribe
to our channel, like this video,</text><text start="16.72" dur="2.68">and try the quiz on our website.</text><text start="19.4" dur="3">Now, today&amp;#39;s story.</text><text start="22.4" dur="7.08">Salt. It makes everything taste better,
but it&amp;#39;s also killing people.</text><text start="29.48" dur="5.44">New research has found that adding salt
to your meal may reduce your life</text><text start="34.92" dur="1.68">by two years.</text><text start="36.6" dur="1.68">But the good news is that</text><text start="38.28" dur="5.96">even a small reduction in salt can
make a big difference to your health.</text><text start="44.88" dur="1.24">You&amp;#39;ve been looking at the headlines,</text><text start="46.12" dur="1.64">Beth. What&amp;#39;s the vocabulary?</text><text start="47.76" dur="3.56">We have &amp;#39;deadly&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;knock off&amp;#39;,
and &amp;#39;teatime&amp;#39;.</text><text start="51.32" dur="3.64">This is News Review from
BBC Learning English.</text><text start="59.48" dur="5.2">Let&amp;#39;s have a look now at a first headline.
This one comes from US News.</text><text start="69.56" dur="0.64">So the word</text><text start="70.2" dur="1.88">we are looking at is &amp;#39;deadly&amp;#39;. And Beth,</text><text start="72.08" dur="3.2">there&amp;#39;s a big clue
in the first part of that word</text><text start="75.28" dur="3.56">&amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;. Yes, we see in this headline
that&amp;#39;s the salt shaker -</text><text start="78.84" dur="4.88">that&amp;#39;s the thing you pour salt on
to your food with - may be deadly.</text><text start="83.72" dur="1.56">Now, that&amp;#39;s an adjective, and</text><text start="85.28" dur="2.36">it just means &amp;#39;likely to kill&amp;#39;.</text><text start="87.64" dur="5.84">Yeah. And we see this word often in
connection with substances, diseases,</text><text start="93.48" dur="2.16">dangerous situations, and animals.</text><text start="95.64" dur="1.16">Isn&amp;#39;t that right?
Yeah.</text><text start="96.8" dur="3.68">So, for example, a deadly spider is
one that can kill you.</text><text start="100.48" dur="3.28">But like so many of the words we look
at in News Review,</text><text start="103.76" dur="2.4">it has another,
very different meaning, and</text><text start="106.16" dur="2.2">I&amp;#39;m deadly serious about that.</text><text start="108.36" dur="3.28">There we go,
Neil. Yep, &amp;#39;deadly&amp;#39;, as you&amp;#39;ve used it</text><text start="111.64" dur="5.92">there, means &amp;#39;completely&amp;#39;, and we often
use it with dull, boring and serious.</text><text start="117.56" dur="1.28">&amp;#39;Deadly dull&amp;#39;.</text><text start="118.84" dur="3.04">&amp;#39;Deadly boring&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;Deadly serious&amp;#39;.</text><text start="121.88" dur="1.04">You do look a bit serious</text><text start="122.92" dur="1.2">there Neil.</text><text start="124.12" dur="5.04">Sorry, I was just thinking about that deadly
spider. And get ready for the bonus word</text><text start="129.16" dur="3.2">now, Beth.
Spiders are dead scary.</text><text start="132.36" dur="1.96">They are, you are dead right, Neil.</text><text start="134.32" dur="3.36">So some people use &amp;#39;dead&amp;#39;
in this way too.</text><text start="137.68" dur="3.36">Especially if they are from the north
of England, and it can mean</text><text start="141.04" dur="3.24">&amp;#39;completely&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;very&amp;#39;. &amp;#39;Dead right&amp;#39;.</text><text start="144.28" dur="2.32">&amp;#39;Dead easy&amp;#39;.
&amp;#39;Dead interesting&amp;#39;.</text><text start="146.6" dur="4.52">Yes. And what&amp;#39;s really interesting,
or dead interesting, about this use is</text><text start="151.12" dur="3.6">that we use it for good things, so &amp;#39;dead
easy&amp;#39;.</text><text start="154.72" dur="4.36">Yeah, or dead good, but
we don&amp;#39;t say &amp;#39;deadly easy&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;deadly</text><text start="159.08" dur="4.36">good&amp;#39;. Best to keep &amp;#39;deadly&amp;#39; for dull,
boring or serious things.</text><text start="163.44" dur="2.4">Let&amp;#39;s take another look at that.</text><text start="172.2" dur="1.24">Let&amp;#39;s have a look at our next</text><text start="173.44" dur="3.08">like this one is from nine News
in Australia.</text><text start="182.8" dur="1.88">We are looking at the phrasal verb</text><text start="184.68" dur="3.64">&amp;#39;knock off&amp;#39;. And it&amp;#39;s a phrasal verb,</text><text start="188.32" dur="2.88">so, unfortunately,
it&amp;#39;s got lots of different meanings.</text><text start="191.2" dur="2">Yeah. You&amp;#39;re right.
But in this headline,</text><text start="193.2" dur="1.92">it just means &amp;#39;reduce&amp;#39;.</text><text start="195.12" dur="2.72">Let&amp;#39;s think literally.</text><text start="199.2" dur="1.8">Imagine you have a pile of things,</text><text start="201" dur="1.52">say books,</text><text start="202.52" dur="4.08">and you knock one off the top.
That happens.</text><text start="206.6" dur="3.4">Yeah. And so
the size of the pile is smaller.</text><text start="210" dur="1.12">It&amp;#39;s reduced.</text><text start="211.12" dur="2.4">Exactly. So in this headline,</text><text start="213.52" dur="4.92">we see that too much salt
can knock years off your life.</text><text start="218.44" dur="1.72">It can reduce the number of years</text><text start="220.16" dur="2.64">you live. That
doesn&amp;#39;t sound too good.</text><text start="222.8" dur="3.76">We can also knock a few pounds
off the price of something. So,</text><text start="226.56" dur="4.04">for example,
if I&amp;#39;m selling this beautiful luxury</text><text start="230.6" dur="3">watch, and you think
it&amp;#39;s too expensive.</text><text start="233.6" dur="3">That&amp;#39;s right.
Can you knock ten pounds off it?</text><text start="236.6" dur="5.28">I want him to reduce the price.
I&amp;#39;ll think about it.</text><text start="241.88" dur="3.16">Talking of selling watches,
it&amp;#39;s got another meaning, hasn&amp;#39;t it?</text><text start="245.04" dur="4">Yeah, we can also use &amp;#39;knock off&amp;#39;
as a single word, with</text><text start="249.04" dur="2.96">or without a hyphen, and this time</text><text start="252" dur="1.12">it means &amp;#39;a cheap,</text><text start="253.12" dur="3.08">possibly illegal copy of a real product&amp;#39;.</text><text start="256.2" dur="1.56">So, actually Neil,</text><text start="257.76" dur="3.4">I don&amp;#39;t think I want that watch.
It&amp;#39;s a knock off. How dare you?</text><text start="261.16" dur="1.64">Let&amp;#39;s have another look at that.</text><text start="270.24" dur="1.64">Our next headline, then, please.</text><text start="271.88" dur="2.24">This one comes from The Sun.</text><text start="282.32" dur="1.56">We&amp;#39;re looking at &amp;#39;teatime&amp;#39;.</text><text start="283.88" dur="1.28">This is easy enough.</text><text start="285.16" dur="2.2">It&amp;#39;s the time when you have tea.</text><text start="287.36" dur="2.08">Everybody knows what tea is.</text><text start="289.44" dur="1.88">But you don&amp;#39;t put salt in it.</text><text start="291.32" dur="1.08">Well, that depends,</text><text start="292.4" dur="1.48">Neil. Tea is,</text><text start="293.88" dur="4.36">of course, a drink, and you definitely
don&amp;#39;t want to put salt in it,</text><text start="298.24" dur="2.24">but tea is also a meal.</text><text start="300.48" dur="3.52">Teatime is traditionally a small meal
in the afternoon</text><text start="304" dur="3.08">with tea and
cake. Yes,</text><text start="307.08" dur="4.92">but there is more to tea, and this is
where it can get quite confusing,</text><text start="312" dur="4.72">because depending on where you live,
tea means different things. Beth,</text><text start="316.72" dur="1.8">you are for the north of England.</text><text start="318.52" dur="3.32">I am. And I call the meal that
I have in the evening,</text><text start="321.84" dur="2.08">my main meal, tea.</text><text start="323.92" dur="1.32">So I would say:</text><text start="325.24" dur="2.28">&amp;#39;Do you want to come round for tea?&amp;#39;</text><text start="327.52" dur="2.08">Neil, you&amp;#39;re from the south
of England, aren&amp;#39;t you?</text><text start="329.6" dur="4.4">Yes, I&amp;#39;m from the south, and I call
my main meal in the evening &amp;#39;dinner&amp;#39;</text><text start="334" dur="3.12">and I would ask somebody if they
want to come for dinner?</text><text start="337.12" dur="1.32">So, teatime</text><text start="338.44" dur="3.8">can be an afternoon meal
or an evening meal. Though</text><text start="342.24" dur="3.28">not everyone uses &amp;#39;teatime&amp;#39;
in this way.</text><text start="345.52" dur="3.08">Let&amp;#39;s take a look
at that one more time.</text><text start="354.84" dur="1.56">We&amp;#39;ve had &amp;#39;deadly&amp;#39; -</text><text start="356.4" dur="3.28">it can kill you. &amp;#39;Knock off&amp;#39; - reduce,</text><text start="359.68" dur="1.64">and &amp;#39;teatime&amp;#39; - a meal</text><text start="361.32" dur="2.92">for some in the afternoon
or the evening.</text><text start="364.24" dur="2.56">Don&amp;#39;t forget
there&amp;#39;s a quiz on our website.</text><text start="366.8" dur="1.8">Thank you for joining us
and see you next time,</text><text start="368.6" dur="2">goodbye. Bye.</text></transcript>

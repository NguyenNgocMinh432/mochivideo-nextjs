change is destabilizing our world.  </text><text start="6.32" dur="4.4">It seems our emissions will not fall quickly 
enough to avoid runaway warming and we may  </text><text start="10.72" dur="5.2">soon hit tipping points that will lead to the 
collapse of ecosystems and our civilization.</text><text start="16.8" dur="4">While scientists, activists and much 
of the younger generation urge action,  </text><text start="20.8" dur="3.92">it appears most politicians are not 
committed to do anything meaningful  </text><text start="24.72" dur="5.68">while the fossil fuel industry still works 
actively against change. It seems humanity  </text><text start="30.4" dur="5.36">can’t overcome its greed and obsession with short 
term profit and personal gain to save itself.</text><text start="36.72" dur="5.6">And so for many the future looks grim and 
hopeless. Young people feel particularly  </text><text start="42.32" dur="4.72">anxious and depressed. Instead of looking 
ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they  </text><text start="47.04" dur="4.16">wonder if they will even have a future or 
if they should bring kids into this world.  </text><text start="52.08" dur="5.76">It’s an age of doom and hopelessness and 
giving up seems the only sensible thing to do.</text><text start="58.4" dur="13.44">But that’s not true. You are not 
doomed. Humanity is not doomed.  </text><text start="73.44" dur="5.84">Despite the seriousness of the situation, for 
years positive trends have accumulated and there  </text><text start="79.28" dur="5.92">is finally some good news and a clear path towards 
our collective climate goals. Welcome to our Ted  </text><text start="85.2" dur="5.12">talk, please watch this video to the end – check 
out our detailed sources afterwards to learn more.</text><text start="91.04" dur="3.04">Ok! Let’s start with the scariest things.</text><text start="95.44" dur="1.44">Canceling the Apocalypse</text><text start="98.16" dur="5.12">Some of the most widely shared stories about 
Climate Change are that it is an existential  </text><text start="103.28" dur="5.12">threat – the end of human civilization and 
maybe even our own extinction event. And  </text><text start="108.4" dur="3.92">that it is basically unavoidable now. 
But what does science actually say?</text><text start="113.04" dur="2.64">As of 2022 the global average temperature  </text><text start="115.68" dur="3.68">has risen 1.2 degrees celsius 
compared to preindustrial times.  </text><text start="120.24" dur="4.64">Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees was the 
most ambitious goal of the Paris agreement  </text><text start="124.88" dur="6.24">but we are not likely to meet it. Already with the 
warming we have today, hot places will get hotter,  </text><text start="131.12" dur="5.36">wet places wetter and the risk and strength of 
extreme weather events increase significantly.</text><text start="137.44" dur="5.6">Warming beyond 2 degrees makes all of these 
extremes more extreme, extreme weather events  </text><text start="143.04" dur="5.52">more common with more ecosystems under 
major pressure. Some will not survive.</text><text start="149.52" dur="4.4">At 3 degrees significant parts of earth, 
especially in developing countries,  </text><text start="153.92" dur="4.96">might become unable to feed their populations. 
Heat waves will become a major global issue.  </text><text start="159.44" dur="4.88">Large scale natural systems will break 
down. The scale and frequency of hurricanes,  </text><text start="164.32" dur="6.56">fires and droughts will further increase and cause 
trillions in damage. Poor regions and subsistence  </text><text start="170.88" dur="5.04">farmers will be hit the hardest. Hundreds of 
millions of people will need to leave their homes.</text><text start="176.64" dur="5.68">In the 4-8 degree range the apocalypse begins 
– the hothouse earth, where things change  </text><text start="182.32" dur="4.56">so quickly, that it may become unable 
to support our large human population  </text><text start="186.88" dur="4.24">and billions may perish, leaving 
the rest on a hostile alien planet.  </text><text start="192.08" dur="6">A decade ago, for lack of action and perspective, 
many scientists assumed a 4+ degree world was our  </text><text start="198.08" dur="4.48">future and a lot of public communication 
focused on exactly this future path.  </text><text start="203.52" dur="4.24">Luckily, it&amp;#39;s much less likely that this 
version of the apocalypse will come to pass.</text><text start="209.12" dur="6.72">If current climate policies stagnate, we’re 
likely to end up with warming 3 °C by 2100.  </text><text start="216.64" dur="8.16">Which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable. 
But this is actually good news – how? In the last  </text><text start="224.8" dur="4.72">decade, we have seen enough progress that most 
scientists now think that we have likely avoided  </text><text start="229.52" dur="6.08">apocalyptic climate change. Although substantial 
risk still remains, we can pretty confidently say  </text><text start="235.6" dur="6.08">that humanity isn’t going anywhere. Civilization 
might have to change, but it will endure.</text><text start="242.56" dur="5.96">Which begs the question: What has changed over 
the last ten years and is this really good news?</text><text start="248.52" dur="2.12">## The Invisible Shift</text><text start="251.76" dur="3.44">You probably know this story: The 
last decade has been an immense  </text><text start="255.2" dur="2">failure for climate policies around the world.  </text><text start="257.84" dur="4.32">Instead of passing comprehensive, binding 
bills that would meaningfully reduce emissions  </text><text start="262.16" dur="6.64">we mostly did: nothing. A lost decade with one 
negative record after another. And this story  </text><text start="268.8" dur="5.36">is true and it is one reason why so many people 
are giving up. But it is not the whole picture.</text><text start="274.96" dur="2.64">Despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing  </text><text start="277.6" dur="3.52">lobbying and misinformation campaigns 
from the fossil fuel industries,  </text><text start="281.12" dur="5.76">there was a lot of progress. Let us go back 
20 years to see why today is so different:</text><text start="288" dur="5.04">Between 2000 and 2010, greenhouse 
gas emissions had grown by 24%,  </text><text start="293.84" dur="5.28">three times as much as the increase in the 
previous decade. Subsidies for fossil fuels  </text><text start="299.12" dur="4.56">aimed at promoting economic growth, caused 
a colossal increase in their consumption.  </text><text start="304.32" dur="4.48">For emerging countries like China and 
India coal was the cheapest fuel for growth  </text><text start="308.8" dur="2.96">while rich countries showed little 
interest in changing their ways.</text><text start="312.4" dur="4.8">In 2010, many people expected these trends 
to continue. Instead of decreasing fossil  </text><text start="317.2" dur="5.44">fuel use its consumption would rise. The next 
decade turned out to be very different though.</text><text start="323.84" dur="5.12">First of all, coal burning in emerging countries 
like India has been slowed down or leveled off,  </text><text start="328.96" dur="4.24">like in China. And it has plummeted 
in rich countries like the UK and US.  </text><text start="334.08" dur="5.12">Since 2015 three-quarters of planned coal 
plants have been canceled and 44 countries  </text><text start="339.2" dur="5.04">have committed to stop building them. Ten years 
ago that would have seemed like wishful thinking,  </text><text start="344.24" dur="6">but today we can say with confidence: Coal 
is dying. It is just not competitive anymore.  </text><text start="350.24" dur="6.32">Because technologies we thought would remain 
expensive matured rapidly instead. Renewable  </text><text start="356.56" dur="6.16">electricity has shown explosive progress. In a 
mere decade wind energy got three times cheaper.  </text><text start="363.28" dur="5.84">Solar electricity is now ten times cheaper! 
Cheaper than coal or any other fossil-fuel burning  </text><text start="369.12" dur="5.36">power plant, despite the massive subsidies and 
global infrastructure propping up fossil fuels.</text><text start="375.44" dur="6.24">25 times more solar and nearly 5 times more wind 
electricity is produced today compared with ten  </text><text start="381.68" dur="5.68">years ago, which is of course not nearly enough. 
One of the biggest obstacles is the variability  </text><text start="387.36" dur="5.6">of their power output. Renewables need a lot of 
energy storage to be a reliable power source,  </text><text start="392.96" dur="7.36">like expensive batteries. Amazingly battery 
prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years,  </text><text start="400.32" dur="5.6">60% in the last decade alone – which will serve 
all kinds of green technology like electric cars.</text><text start="406.88" dur="4.16">You might say, well that’s great but 
didn’t Kurzgesagt’s last climate video  </text><text start="411.04" dur="4.72">say that while wind and solar are nice, we need 
nothing less than a fundamental transition of  </text><text start="415.76" dur="6.4">our global industrial system? Yes but luckily 
the shift goes beyond just the energy sector.  </text><text start="422.16" dur="4.48">Throughout the economy people are working on 
improving current technology to lower emissions.</text><text start="427.68" dur="5.68">We’re rapidly replacing old incandescent light 
bulbs with LEDs that are ten times more efficient.  </text><text start="433.92" dur="4.4">In 2020 about 7 out of 10 new 
cars in Norway were electric  </text><text start="438.32" dur="5.92">or hybrid – In 2021 it was already 
8 out of 10. And the list goes on,  </text><text start="444.24" dur="5.6">from electric heating and better insulation 
to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel.</text><text start="449.84" dur="1.92">Wherever you look you find scientists,  </text><text start="451.76" dur="3.84">engineers and entrepreneurs trying to 
solve some aspect of climate change.  </text><text start="456.4" dur="4.08">Enormous amounts of human ingenuity are 
being brought to bear on this problem  </text><text start="460.48" dur="6.16">with more and more people deciding to prioritize 
preventing rapid climate change. Solutions for  </text><text start="466.64" dur="5.84">low-carbon production of cement, electronics and 
steel, and innovations like artificial meat and  </text><text start="472.48" dur="5.2">carbon capture are in the works. The more of 
these technologies we deploy; the cheaper new  </text><text start="477.68" dur="5.68">and better technology gets. The cheaper they 
get, the more people use them. And so on.</text><text start="483.36" dur="1.84">We can see the impact already:  </text><text start="485.2" dur="4.08">The domestic CO2 output of rich countries 
is falling without a major recession.  </text><text start="490" dur="8.8">Since the year 2000, the EU as a whole shows a 
21% decrease, Italy 28%, the UK 35%, Denmark 43%.</text><text start="499.84" dur="4.8">But the best news may be that emissions are no 
longer necessarily coupled with economic growth.  </text><text start="505.36" dur="5.6">In the past this was an inconvenient truth 
– to get richer, you had to emit more. Which  </text><text start="510.96" dur="3.92">led to fierce arguments between developing 
and developed countries about the fairness  </text><text start="514.88" dur="4.48">of reducing emissions while their populations 
were still poor. But in the last decade we have  </text><text start="519.36" dur="4.96">seen that it IS possible to increase prosperity 
without increasing emissions. Emissions in the  </text><text start="524.32" dur="8.16">Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP grew 
by 27%! France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14%  </text><text start="533.12" dur="8.64">while increasing GDP by 15%! Romania saw 
an 8% decrease and 35% growth! And even the  </text><text start="541.76" dur="6.56">largest economy on earth - the USA - decreased 
emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26%!</text><text start="549.76" dur="4.56">Some of you may call this a numbers trick. That 
rich countries are just exporting emissions to  </text><text start="554.32" dur="4.8">poorer nations by moving the dirty parts of 
their economies like manufacturing. But even  </text><text start="559.12" dur="5.36">when we account for all of our imported goods, 
the numbers still look positive! It’s no longer  </text><text start="564.48" dur="4.88">a matter of having to choose between prosperity 
and the climate as it seemed to be a decade ago.</text><text start="570" dur="4">Developing countries will profit from 
that because as rich countries pay for  </text><text start="574" dur="5.28">the expensive development of green technologies, 
they can adopt them more cheaply. They can skip  </text><text start="579.28" dur="3.04">most of the high emission phase that 
today&amp;#39;s rich countries went through.  </text><text start="582.96" dur="4.48">We are at the point where not 
decarbonizing is a bad business decision.</text><text start="588.48" dur="3.36">And we haven’t even really talked 
about solutions like carbon capture.  </text><text start="592.56" dur="7.12">In 2000 it didn&amp;#39;t really exist. In 2022 that 
technology does exist and costs around $600 to  </text><text start="599.68" dur="5.52">remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere. As 
investment pours in and the technology matures  </text><text start="605.2" dur="4.56">and begins to scale, it is likely that these 
costs will plummet over the next few decades.</text><text start="610.32" dur="5.52">So everything&amp;#39;s fine then? Well let us not get 
carried away here - all of these processes are  </text><text start="615.84" dur="5.2">great but not nearly fast enough. We are still 
doing way too little and technology will not  </text><text start="621.04" dur="5.12">magically solve everything. We need to use 
fewer resources and use them longer, design  </text><text start="626.16" dur="5.76">consumer goods that are repairable and durable 
and decrease our energy requirements. We need  </text><text start="631.92" dur="4.8">much better infrastructure, agriculture 
and cities. It will still be hard work,  </text><text start="636.72" dur="3.36">especially to get the right 
policies passed and enacted.</text><text start="640.08" dur="1.44">But for the first time ever,  </text><text start="641.52" dur="4.4">there are a few trendlines pointing 
solidly in the right direction.</text><text start="645.92" dur="5.12">And now imagine – If all of this was achieved 
without proper financial and political support  </text><text start="651.04" dur="4.4">and despite fossil fuel lobbying 
– just think what humanity can do  </text><text start="655.44" dur="4.4">when climate change finally gets the 
political attention and funding it needs.</text><text start="659.84" dur="4.96">So is it ok to feel hopeful again? The 
situation is still dire and serious,  </text><text start="664.8" dur="2.72">so what is the point of focusing 
on this side of the story?</text><text start="669.76" dur="1.44">The Trap of Hopelessness</text><text start="672.16" dur="5.2">Climate change can feel overwhelming and 
make your future seem bleak. The sadness  </text><text start="677.36" dur="5.84">and hopelessness that many people feel is real 
and very destructive because it causes apathy.</text><text start="683.2" dur="4.16">Apathy that is only serving the fossil 
fuel industry that is still delaying  </text><text start="687.36" dur="4.72">change however it can. In a sense 
they have weaponized hopelessness.  </text><text start="692.96" dur="4.16">We are now in phase 4 in the public 
debate about rapid climate change action:</text><text start="697.84" dur="3.36">Phase 1 was: Climate Change is not real.</text><text start="701.2" dur="4.48">Phase 2 was: Climate Change is 
real but not caused by humans.</text><text start="705.68" dur="4.16">Phase 3 was: Climate Change may be 
caused by humans but it’s not that bad.</text><text start="710.56" dur="6.24">Phase 4 is: Climate Change is no longer avoidable. 
We are doomed and it doesn’t matter what we do.</text><text start="717.68" dur="5.04">If we want the world to change, we first need 
to believe that change is possible. And we have  </text><text start="722.72" dur="5.44">an abundance of evidence that it is. Changes 
to our industrial system are gaining momentum,  </text><text start="728.16" dur="4.88">technology gets better and cheaper, climate change 
has become a key issue in most free elections.  </text><text start="733.6" dur="3.04">As more and more younger people 
move into influential positions,  </text><text start="736.64" dur="6.08">they prioritize climate change and work on 
new solutions. In 2022 most governments not  </text><text start="742.72" dur="5.92">only acknowledge it but set their own net zero 
goals – in democratic and autocratic countries.  </text><text start="749.44" dur="5.2">The results of years of fighting a steep 
uphill battle are now clearly visible. The  </text><text start="754.64" dur="5.2">pressure needs to keep increasing, to make sure 
that the promises made today are actually kept!</text><text start="761.12" dur="4.8">Climate doomerism is the equivalent of giving up 
even though you can still prevent not just the  </text><text start="765.92" dur="5.2">worst case but also mitigate most of the bad 
things, make changes in time to adapt better  </text><text start="771.12" dur="6.24">and prevent the poorest from suffering. That is 
why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous.</text><text start="778.08" dur="3.76">If the last, in many ways wasted 
decade, has shown anything,  </text><text start="781.84" dur="6.56">then it’s that progress is being made and that 
dire scenarios are just predictions – not our  </text><text start="788.4" dur="6.48">sealed fate. As of 2022, based on current global 
policies, we will end up in a 3 degrees world.  </text><text start="795.92" dur="4.64">Now it is our job to yet again prove the 
predictions wrong – despite how serious and  </text><text start="800.56" dur="6.32">urgent things are. To turn that 3 degrees into a 
2 degrees and then see where we can go from there.</text><text start="806.88" dur="6.64">For that we need hope. And we hope we gave you 
that today, at least a little. That you feel  </text><text start="813.52" dur="5.2">that things are serious but also that you have 
a future. That you can have kids without dooming  </text><text start="818.72" dur="6.56">them or the world. That taking action today is 
worth it. And that despite powerful industries  </text><text start="825.28" dur="6.08">doing everything to delay it, society is changing. 
If you need a more concrete roadmap of what you  </text><text start="831.36" dur="4.4">can do personally – we are working on a follow 
up video to talk about that in greater detail.</text><text start="836.96" dur="3.76">Doomerism, inactivity and weaponized hopelessness  </text><text start="840.72" dur="5.6">are the only trump cards left for the powers 
that don’t want change. Don’t let them win.</text><text start="850.56" dur="3.76">We are still excited about the future. 
And we think one of the best things  </text><text start="854.32" dur="4.08">you can do to keep your optimism and 
curiosity up is to learn new things.  </text><text start="859.28" dur="4.48">If you don’t know where to start, our friends

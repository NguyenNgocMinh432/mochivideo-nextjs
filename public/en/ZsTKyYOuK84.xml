attempting to redefine yourself.</text><text start="17.01" dur="3.32">Self-love is gaining an
appreciation for yourself</text><text start="20.33" dur="3.15">through the physical,
emotional and spiritual support</text><text start="23.48" dur="1.95">you provide yourself with.</text><text start="25.43" dur="3.02">It&amp;#39;s not a fixed state,
but can grow over time</text><text start="28.45" dur="2.77">through actions that lead to maturity.</text><text start="31.22" dur="3.52">Establishing self love
can be a long journey</text><text start="34.74" dur="2.37">but it&amp;#39;s a vital step to
improving your mental health</text><text start="37.11" dur="1.52">and overall happiness.</text><text start="38.63" dur="3.68">So, here are a few tips that
may help you along the way.</text><text start="42.31" dur="3.32">Number one, forgive yourself.</text><text start="45.63" dur="2.46">Are you incredibly tough on yourself?</text><text start="48.09" dur="2.87">Sometimes when you&amp;#39;re
struggling for perfection</text><text start="50.96" dur="4.25">you end up overlooking the
fact that you&amp;#39;re only human.</text><text start="55.21" dur="1.4">Although you may tell yourself</text><text start="56.61" dur="2.44">that you&amp;#39;re just holding
yourself accountable,</text><text start="59.05" dur="2.45">too much self-deprecation can be harmful</text><text start="61.5" dur="1.26">to your mental health.</text><text start="62.76" dur="2.48">Instead, learning to forgive yourself</text><text start="65.24" dur="1.16">for the mistakes you make</text><text start="66.4" dur="2.47">and treating them as
opportunities to grow,</text><text start="68.87" dur="3.1">is a step towards practicing self-love.</text><text start="71.97" dur="2.83">Number two, be mindful.</text><text start="74.8" dur="3.18">Are the goals you set for
yourself really what you want</text><text start="77.98" dur="2.66">or are they pushed onto you by society?</text><text start="80.64" dur="2.44">Being introspective or mindful</text><text start="83.08" dur="2.73">can give you a sense of
clarity into who you are</text><text start="85.81" dur="2.8">how you think and what you want.</text><text start="88.61" dur="2.34">It arms you with self knowledge</text><text start="90.95" dur="2.44">that you can use to move forward.</text><text start="93.39" dur="1.55">Some ways to practice mindfulness</text><text start="94.94" dur="2.53">include keeping a journal, meditating</text><text start="97.47" dur="2.92">or just taking some time to self-reflect.</text><text start="100.39" dur="3.7">Number three, act on what you need.</text><text start="104.09" dur="1.68">Do you know what gives you energy?</text><text start="105.77" dur="1.66">What makes you happy?</text><text start="107.43" dur="1.73">Perhaps you&amp;#39;re feeling overwhelmed</text><text start="109.16" dur="2.09">with needing to spend so
much time with your friends</text><text start="111.25" dur="3.26">or colleagues, but feel bad
for wanting to step away.</text><text start="114.51" dur="2.78">Choosing to go anyways may
end up draining your energy</text><text start="117.29" dur="2">and leaving you exhausted.</text><text start="119.29" dur="2.47">That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important
to identify the things</text><text start="121.76" dur="1.23">that make you feel better</text><text start="122.99" dur="2.45">versus the things that
make you feel worse.</text><text start="125.44" dur="2.37">Knowing what you need
and acting on those needs</text><text start="127.81" dur="1.56">is a form of self love.</text><text start="129.37" dur="1.91">And it can go a long way for your mental</text><text start="131.28" dur="1.77">and emotional wellbeing</text><text start="133.05" dur="3.78">which brings us to number
four, set boundaries.</text><text start="136.83" dur="1.18">Are there certain behaviors</text><text start="138.01" dur="1.94">that you&amp;#39;re not willing to put up with?</text><text start="139.95" dur="2.53">The purpose of setting
boundaries is not to kick people</text><text start="142.48" dur="2.16">out of your life but
rather to help you identify</text><text start="144.64" dur="3.69">what is acceptable or welcomed
in your life and what&amp;#39;s not.</text><text start="148.33" dur="1.97">Healthy boundaries help
you filter out things</text><text start="150.3" dur="2.64">that drain your energy,
harm you emotionally,</text><text start="152.94" dur="2.03">physically or spiritually.</text><text start="154.97" dur="1.25">A way to set boundaries</text><text start="156.22" dur="3.15">is by starting with
Maslow&amp;#39;s hierarchy of needs.</text><text start="159.37" dur="2.7">Figure out what you need
to feel loved or accepted</text><text start="162.07" dur="1.63">and then work from there.</text><text start="163.7" dur="2.75">Number five, protect yourself.</text><text start="166.45" dur="2.54">What type of people do you
surround yourself with?</text><text start="168.99" dur="3.44">Another way to practice self
love is to protect yourself.</text><text start="172.43" dur="2.13">This may mean bringing
people into your life</text><text start="174.56" dur="1.62">who will be supportive and who contribute</text><text start="176.18" dur="2.32">to your emotional, mental
and spiritual health</text><text start="178.5" dur="1.83">instead of tearing it apart.</text><text start="180.33" dur="1.43">Getting rid of fake friends</text><text start="181.76" dur="2.82">or anyone who takes pleasure
in your misery is important</text><text start="184.58" dur="2.66">for your self esteem and self confidence.</text><text start="187.24" dur="3.8">Number six, live intentionally.</text><text start="191.04" dur="1.97">What makes your eyes light up?</text><text start="193.01" dur="1.78">What inspires you?</text><text start="194.79" dur="1.97">Sometimes it&amp;#39;s easy to
just follow a routine</text><text start="196.76" dur="1.06">in your day to day life</text><text start="197.82" dur="2.68">to the point where you
stopped giving it much thought</text><text start="200.5" dur="2.55">but it&amp;#39;s important to
live life with intention</text><text start="203.05" dur="3.1">and to make choices that help
you move towards your goals.</text><text start="206.15" dur="1.11">For example,</text><text start="207.26" dur="3.43">if you intend to live a
peaceful and healthy life</text><text start="210.69" dur="2.47">you need to make choices
that support that goal</text><text start="213.16" dur="2.14">that may include learning how to meditate</text><text start="215.3" dur="2.82">or starting to change
your diet for the better.</text><text start="218.12" dur="3.16">Number seven, show up for yourself.</text><text start="221.28" dur="2.26">Do you scold yourself when
you don&amp;#39;t finish everything</text><text start="223.54" dur="1.44">you set out to do?</text><text start="224.98" dur="2.22">There will be times where
you don&amp;#39;t accomplish</text><text start="227.2" dur="1.6">everything you plan to do</text><text start="228.8" dur="2.78">but, acknowledging the effort you&amp;#39;ve given</text><text start="231.58" dur="2.97">and the amount you have done is important.</text><text start="234.55" dur="2.4">It&amp;#39;s easy to focus on only your fault</text><text start="236.95" dur="2.89">but showing yourself
kindness and compassion,</text><text start="239.84" dur="2.43">even in how you talk to
yourself can help override</text><text start="242.27" dur="2.56">some of the negative mental
patterns you may have</text><text start="244.83" dur="2.83">and help you feel loved and supported.</text><text start="247.66" dur="3.27">And number eight, practice self-care.</text><text start="250.93" dur="2.77">Do you tend to ignore
your needs sometimes?</text><text start="253.7" dur="3.17">Taking care of your basic
needs is an act of love.</text><text start="256.87" dur="2.27">Even taking a few minutes
out of your day to check in</text><text start="259.14" dur="1.57">and provide yourself with what you need</text><text start="260.71" dur="1.93">can help you feel a lot better.</text><text start="262.64" dur="2.39">Whether it&amp;#39;s soaking in a hot bath,</text><text start="265.03" dur="2.35">eating something healthy
or even working out.</text><text start="267.38" dur="2.07">Practicing self-care can go a long way</text><text start="269.45" dur="2.45">for your mental health and your happiness.</text><text start="271.9" dur="2.64">Have you practiced any of
these types of self-love?</text><text start="274.54" dur="1.8">Let us know in the comments below.</text><text start="276.34" dur="2.82">If you found this video helpful,

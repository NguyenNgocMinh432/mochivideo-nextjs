<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="7.712" dur="2.502">What’s the best country 
in the world to live in?</text><text start="10.298" dur="3.587">Is it the one with the best food?
The longest life expectancy?</text><text start="14.01" dur="1.376">The best weather?</text><text start="15.47" dur="4.713">For the past 70 years, most governments 
have relied heavily on a single number</text><text start="20.183" dur="1.293">to answer that question.</text><text start="21.726" dur="3.962">This number influences elections, 
the stock market, and government policy.</text><text start="25.813" dur="2.336">But it was never intended
for its current purpose;</text><text start="28.149" dur="4.922">and some would argue that the world 
is addicted to making it grow... forever.</text><text start="33.488" dur="3.503">This number is called 
the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP,</text><text start="37.116" dur="3.837">and it was invented by the economist
Simon Kuznets in the 1930s,</text><text start="40.953" dur="4.088">to try and gauge the size of an economy
in a single, easy to understand number.</text><text start="45.458" dur="3.211">GDP is the total monetary value 
of everything a country</text><text start="48.669" dur="2.253">produces and sells on the market.</text><text start="50.922" dur="2.169">To this day, GDP per capita,</text><text start="53.091" dur="4.087">which is just the total GDP divided by the
number of people living in that country,</text><text start="57.178" dur="2.461">is widely seen as a measure of well-being.</text><text start="59.931" dur="3.003">But GDP doesn’t actually say anything
direct about well-being,</text><text start="62.934" dur="2.836">because it doesn&amp;#39;t take into account
what a country produces</text><text start="65.77" dur="1.626">or who has access to it.</text><text start="67.563" dur="4.213">A million dollars of weapons contributes 
the exact same amount to a country’s GDP</text><text start="71.776" dur="2.586">as a million dollars of vaccines or food.</text><text start="74.821" dur="3.753">The value society derives from things
like public school or firefighters</text><text start="78.574" dur="4.255">isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those
services aren’t sold on the market.</text><text start="83.121" dur="2.002">And if a country has a lot of wealth,</text><text start="85.123" dur="3.044">but most of it is controlled
by relatively few people,</text><text start="88.167" dur="4.672">GDP per capita gives a distorted picture
of how much money a typical person has.</text><text start="93.381" dur="1.752">Despite all that, for a long time,</text><text start="95.133" dur="3.253">higher GDP did correlate closely
to a higher quality of life</text><text start="98.386" dur="1.543">for people in many countries.</text><text start="100.346" dur="4.63">From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,
tripled or even quadrupled</text><text start="104.976" dur="1.71">in some western economies,</text><text start="106.686" dur="2.794">people’s wages often grew proportionally.</text><text start="109.605" dur="2.044">By the 1980s, this changed.</text><text start="111.899" dur="1.919">Countries continued to grow richer,</text><text start="113.818" dur="2.836">but wages stopped keeping pace 
with GDP growth,</text><text start="116.654" dur="1.919">or in some cases, even declined,</text><text start="118.573" dur="3.878">and most of the benefits went to an 
ever-smaller percentage of the population.</text><text start="122.743" dur="3.712">Still, the idea of capturing
a nation’s well-being in a single number</text><text start="126.455" dur="2.002">had powerful appeal.</text><text start="128.499" dur="3.587">In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk
of Bhutan</text><text start="132.086" dur="3.087">came up with the idea 
of Gross National Happiness</text><text start="135.173" dur="2.293">as an alternative 
to Gross Domestic Product.</text><text start="137.633" dur="2.878">Gross National Happiness is a metric 
that factors in matters</text><text start="140.511" dur="3.379">like health, education, 
strong communities, and living standards,</text><text start="143.89" dur="1.96">having citizens answer questions like,</text><text start="145.85" dur="3.003">“How happy do you think your family
members are at the moment?”</text><text start="149.228" dur="3.712">“What is your knowledge of names of plants
and wild animals in your area?”</text><text start="152.94" dur="2.503">and “What type of day was yesterday?”</text><text start="156.068" dur="3.671">The United Nations’ Human Development
Index is a more widely used metric;</text><text start="159.739" dur="2.377">it takes into account health
and education,</text><text start="162.116" dur="3.212">as well as income per capita 
to estimate overall well-being.</text><text start="165.87" dur="3.045">Meanwhile, a metric called
the Sustainable Development Index</text><text start="168.915" dur="4.629">factors in both well-being and the 
environmental burdens of economic growth,</text><text start="173.544" dur="2.586">again, boiling all this down
to a single number.</text><text start="176.13" dur="1.877">Though no country has been able to meet</text><text start="178.007" dur="1.71">the basic needs of its people while</text><text start="179.717" dur="2.503">also using resources 
fully sustainably,</text><text start="182.22" dur="2.002">Costa Rica currently comes the closest.</text><text start="184.472" dur="1.251">Over the past few decades,</text><text start="185.723" dur="3.587">it’s managed to grow its economy
and improve living standards substantially</text><text start="189.31" dur="2.711">without drastically increasing 
its emissions.</text><text start="192.021" dur="2.002">Other countries,
like Colombia and Jordan,</text><text start="194.023" dur="1.752">have made notable progress.</text><text start="196.025" dur="3.128">Costa Rica now has better well-being
outcomes like life expectancy</text><text start="199.153" dur="2.377">than some of the world’s 
richest countries.</text><text start="201.822" dur="2.711">Ultimately, there are limits 
to any approach that boils</text><text start="204.533" dur="2.837">the quality of life in a country 
down to a single number.</text><text start="207.662" dur="3.67">Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard
approach that lays out all the factors</text><text start="211.332" dur="1.627">a single number obscures.</text><text start="212.959" dur="3.837">This approach makes even more sense given 
that people have different priorities,</text><text start="216.796" dur="2.419">and the answer to which country 
is best to live in</text><text start="219.215" dur="2.085">depends on who’s asking the question.</text><text start="221.3" dur="3.253">So what if that were you designing 
your countries well-being metric?</text><text start="224.553" dur="2.503">What do you value, 
and what would you measure?</text></transcript>

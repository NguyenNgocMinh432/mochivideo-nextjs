dur="4.4">before talking about the tips and tricks</text><text start="35.04" dur="4.64">let me explain my definition of fluency</text><text start="37.52" dur="4.4">because fluency can really differ</text><text start="39.68" dur="3.84">according to your goals for example</text><text start="41.92" dur="4.4">let&amp;#39;s say if you&amp;#39;re learning a language</text><text start="43.52" dur="4.64">in order to pass a certain exam then</text><text start="46.32" dur="4.079">your language goals should be more</text><text start="48.16" dur="5.2">focused on learning the maybe grammar or</text><text start="50.399" dur="5.121">like some exams require essays listening</text><text start="53.36" dur="4.48">practices reading practices or i don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="55.52" dur="3.92">know interview practices maybe about</text><text start="57.84" dur="3.199">those type of things or if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="59.44" dur="3.759">learning a language for business</text><text start="61.039" dur="4.48">purposes rather than focusing on daily</text><text start="63.199" dur="5.041">conversations maybe it&amp;#39;s more important</text><text start="65.519" dur="6.081">to focus on business terms in your niche</text><text start="68.24" dur="5.76">or if your focus is is to socialize with</text><text start="71.6" dur="4.48">people from different countries and use</text><text start="74" dur="3.6">daily conversation then it&amp;#39;s better to</text><text start="76.08" dur="4.24">focus on daily conversational</text><text start="77.6" dur="5.839">vocabularies and like terms so for me</text><text start="80.32" dur="5.52">the main reason to learn languages is</text><text start="83.439" dur="4.081">being able to communicate with people if</text><text start="85.84" dur="3.84">i&amp;#39;m saying something and if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="87.52" dur="4.48">understanding it for me personally</text><text start="89.68" dur="4.479">grammar mistakes or using really</text><text start="92" dur="4.799">difficult vocabularies are not that</text><text start="94.159" dur="4.881">important so according to my goal of</text><text start="96.799" dur="5.041">being able to have a smooth daily</text><text start="99.04" dur="5.6">conversation i measure my fluency</text><text start="101.84" dur="5.44">according to the level of my secondary</text><text start="104.64" dur="5.119">linguistic personality what do i mean by</text><text start="107.28" dur="4.479">secondary lingualistic personality have</text><text start="109.759" dur="4">you ever experienced this when you</text><text start="111.759" dur="4.64">switch languages your personality</text><text start="113.759" dur="5.121">slightly or maybe not even slightly like</text><text start="116.399" dur="5.36">major changes in your personality can</text><text start="118.88" dur="5.76">occur for example in my case for example</text><text start="121.759" dur="5.281">in my case i&amp;#39;m much funnier in japanese</text><text start="124.64" dur="5.039">more logical and also a bit shy and</text><text start="127.04" dur="4.48">distant in german and also according to</text><text start="129.679" dur="4.401">my really close friend i&amp;#39;m more</text><text start="131.52" dur="6.079">sarcastic and friendly and turkish but</text><text start="134.08" dur="5.68">more confident and businesswoman wives</text><text start="137.599" dur="4.321">in english so if your personality</text><text start="139.76" dur="4.08">changes when you switch the languages</text><text start="141.92" dur="4">that is the real fluency because in</text><text start="143.84" dur="4.72">order to secondary linguistic</text><text start="145.92" dur="4.24">characteristics to develop you need to</text><text start="148.56" dur="3.679">experience the culture interact with</text><text start="150.16" dur="3.76">natives and see how they use their</text><text start="152.239" dur="3.521">gestures how they think you know you</text><text start="153.92" dur="4.48">need to understand their values because</text><text start="155.76" dur="4.72">languages have really close relationship</text><text start="158.4" dur="4">with the culture so if you learn a</text><text start="160.48" dur="4.32">language you don&amp;#39;t only learn about the</text><text start="162.4" dur="4">vocabularies and grammar rules you also</text><text start="164.8" dur="3.519">learn about the culture the way they</text><text start="166.4" dur="4.24">think and the value system of that</text><text start="168.319" dur="5.92">language so when i&amp;#39;m learning a language</text><text start="170.64" dur="5.44">my ultimate goal is not being taken as a</text><text start="174.239" dur="4.561">foreigner when i&amp;#39;m talking in that</text><text start="176.08" dur="4.799">language and also if you think languages</text><text start="178.8" dur="3.84">are only about the accent or about the</text><text start="180.879" dur="3.841">vocabularies like how difficult</text><text start="182.64" dur="4.239">vocabularies you use and your grammar</text><text start="184.72" dur="4.08">rules you&amp;#39;re completely wrong the</text><text start="186.879" dur="5.201">gestures the way you understand the</text><text start="188.8" dur="5.359">culture and the way you actually think</text><text start="192.08" dur="4.239">really proves whether you know that</text><text start="194.159" dur="4.401">language very well or not when we learn</text><text start="196.319" dur="5.2">a new language we&amp;#39;ve learned actually a</text><text start="198.56" dur="4.88">new way of thinking new values and</text><text start="201.519" dur="4.401">almost like the way you look to the</text><text start="203.44" dur="4.879">world changes actually when i learned</text><text start="205.92" dur="5.599">german i realized really different ways</text><text start="208.319" dur="5.441">of thinking from the way that germans</text><text start="211.519" dur="4.161">structure their sentences because it</text><text start="213.76" dur="3.68">sounds so different from the other</text><text start="215.68" dur="3.839">languages that i knew i don&amp;#39;t know it</text><text start="217.44" dur="4.24">just like gave me as some sort of a new</text><text start="219.519" dur="4.241">way of thinking it&amp;#39;s more logical and</text><text start="221.68" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s more structured and it&amp;#39;s more like</text><text start="223.76" dur="4.08">it has more rules but i really loved it</text><text start="225.92" dur="4.879">so why developing a secondary</text><text start="227.84" dur="5.679">lingualistic personality is important so</text><text start="230.799" dur="5.36">these examples are just my opinions so</text><text start="233.519" dur="4.08">take them as a grain of salt but i think</text><text start="236.159" dur="3.521">you have better and smoother</text><text start="237.599" dur="4.081">communication let&amp;#39;s say you&amp;#39;re learning</text><text start="239.68" dur="4.16">japanese if you ignore the whole</text><text start="241.68" dur="4.96">japanese culture about like you know for</text><text start="243.84" dur="4.64">example kegel the way we show respect</text><text start="246.64" dur="4.08">when we are talking so let&amp;#39;s say if you</text><text start="248.48" dur="4.16">ignore this kegel and like respecting</text><text start="250.72" dur="3.599">the older person culture even though if</text><text start="252.64" dur="3.839">you&amp;#39;re talking like perfect japanese if</text><text start="254.319" dur="4.88">you don&amp;#39;t understand this culture you</text><text start="256.479" dur="5.761">might sound grammatically correct but it</text><text start="259.199" dur="5.601">might be a bit disrespectful so in order</text><text start="262.24" dur="4.959">to avoid those miscommunications and</text><text start="264.8" dur="4.48">misunderstandings i think developing a</text><text start="267.199" dur="3.761">secondary lingualistic personality is</text><text start="269.28" dur="3.84">really important and also the second</text><text start="270.96" dur="4.56">reason is to be confident in that</text><text start="273.12" dur="3.92">language because if you realize that</text><text start="275.52" dur="3.6">your personality that your whole</text><text start="277.04" dur="4.4">personality your identity is changing in</text><text start="279.12" dur="4.4">that language how cool it is right</text><text start="281.44" dur="4.16">because it shows your dedication and the</text><text start="283.52" dur="4.64">amount of the work you put in third</text><text start="285.6" dur="4.56">reason is to have better understanding</text><text start="288.16" dur="3.759">of people from that language if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="290.16" dur="3.36">developing a secondary lingualistic</text><text start="291.919" dur="4">personality it means that you have a</text><text start="293.52" dur="4.399">good understanding of that culture so</text><text start="295.919" dur="3.681">even if you can understand somebody like</text><text start="297.919" dur="3.681">what they&amp;#39;re saying if you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="299.6" dur="4.159">understand what is behind of that what</text><text start="301.6" dur="4.879">type of culture is that you might think</text><text start="303.759" dur="4.241">that they&amp;#39;re rude or disrespectful but</text><text start="306.479" dur="3.521">maybe in that culture it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="308" dur="4.479">disrespectful it disrespectful and</text><text start="310" dur="4.96">disrespectful really depends on the</text><text start="312.479" dur="5.121">culture and on the value system so</text><text start="314.96" dur="4.4">understanding these will allow you to</text><text start="317.6" dur="4.8">avoid miscommunication and</text><text start="319.36" dur="5.679">misunderstanding okay so one of the tips</text><text start="322.4" dur="4.56">i can give you is that don&amp;#39;t translate</text><text start="325.039" dur="3.681">everything in the beginning of course it</text><text start="326.96" dur="3.76">is important to know the meaning of the</text><text start="328.72" dur="4.24">vocabularies in your native language</text><text start="330.72" dur="5.039">because otherwise how can you know right</text><text start="332.96" dur="4.4">and also translation allows you to have</text><text start="335.759" dur="3.521">a quicker understanding of that</text><text start="337.36" dur="3.76">vocabulary so in the beginning it will</text><text start="339.28" dur="4">actually save you quite a lot of time to</text><text start="341.12" dur="4.32">translate some words even if you want to</text><text start="343.28" dur="4.479">translate in your head don&amp;#39;t abandon</text><text start="345.44" dur="4.56">translating or using a translator</text><text start="347.759" dur="4.241">altogether it&amp;#39;s all about how you use</text><text start="350" dur="4.08">them and how much you use them because</text><text start="352" dur="4.479">as a beginner it&amp;#39;s one of the fastest</text><text start="354.08" dur="5.28">ways to learn a language is to look up</text><text start="356.479" dur="5.84">the translation and memorizing it but as</text><text start="359.36" dur="5.279">you progress you will need to translate</text><text start="362.319" dur="5.041">words less and less so just trust the</text><text start="364.639" dur="5.041">process so how we can decide what to</text><text start="367.36" dur="4.24">translate and what&amp;#39;s not to what i was</text><text start="369.68" dur="3.68">doing when i was learning german and</text><text start="371.6" dur="4">also english was that instead of</text><text start="373.36" dur="4.32">translating word by word firstly try to</text><text start="375.6" dur="4.08">guess the meaning of the vocabulary from</text><text start="377.68" dur="4">the context of the sentence because in</text><text start="379.68" dur="4.32">some situations when you read the whole</text><text start="381.68" dur="4">sentence you can kind of like guess the</text><text start="384" dur="3.759">meaning of the vocabulary but you might</text><text start="385.68" dur="4.48">not be sure and after guessing it you</text><text start="387.759" dur="4.241">can check on the translator whether it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="390.16" dur="4.319">true or not in that way you can</text><text start="392" dur="4.479">associate words with the sentences and</text><text start="394.479" dur="4.801">you can also clearly see how they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="396.479" dur="5.041">used and also like from your guesses i</text><text start="399.28" dur="4">think it&amp;#39;s much easier to memorize</text><text start="401.52" dur="3.84">because let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s something really</text><text start="403.28" dur="3.759">different then you guess it&amp;#39;s much</text><text start="405.36" dur="4">easier to memorize if you&amp;#39;re getting a</text><text start="407.039" dur="4.641">bit comfortable in that language like</text><text start="409.36" dur="4.64">you don&amp;#39;t need to look every word word</text><text start="411.68" dur="4.56">by word in order to understand sentences</text><text start="414" dur="4.319">stop translating words in your native</text><text start="416.24" dur="4.56">language and rather than that look their</text><text start="418.319" dur="4.081">definition in your target language so</text><text start="420.8" dur="3.92">let&amp;#39;s say if you&amp;#39;re an english native</text><text start="422.4" dur="4.239">speaker and if you&amp;#39;re learning japanese</text><text start="424.72" dur="4.72">like stop looking the meaning of the</text><text start="426.639" dur="4.96">words in english and look the definition</text><text start="429.44" dur="4.24">in japanese checking the translation</text><text start="431.599" dur="3.681">might be much faster than looking the</text><text start="433.68" dur="4">definition and trying to understand the</text><text start="435.28" dur="4.72">definition however with the time you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="437.68" dur="4.32">get better at guessing or understanding</text><text start="440" dur="4">meaning of the vocabulary and also by</text><text start="442" dur="4.88">looking at the definition you will learn</text><text start="444" dur="5.36">new vocabularies and also maybe a</text><text start="446.88" dur="4.319">different way to use the same vocabulary</text><text start="449.36" dur="3.52">in the beginning it will take a lot of</text><text start="451.199" dur="3.28">time because instead of translating</text><text start="452.88" dur="3.759">you&amp;#39;re looking to the definition every</text><text start="454.479" dur="4.321">single time and it might be really</text><text start="456.639" dur="4.241">boring and tiring process but don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="458.8" dur="3.92">forget learning a language is a long</text><text start="460.88" dur="4.08">journey we&amp;#39;re not rushing here even if</text><text start="462.72" dur="4">you&amp;#39;re rushing it is a journey so take</text><text start="464.96" dur="4.079">it seriously when learning about new</text><text start="466.72" dur="5.28">vocabularies and also new sentences</text><text start="469.039" dur="5.44">since the journey is so long and might</text><text start="472" dur="4.96">be boring sometimes you can feel really</text><text start="474.479" dur="5.12">lonely and also almost like depressed in</text><text start="476.96" dur="5.12">order to learn vocabularies in a fun way</text><text

rather than the vocabulary</text><text start="621.68" dur="4.56">itself the important of this step is</text><text start="624.16" dur="4.16">that sometimes you can like translate a</text><text start="626.24" dur="4.56">sentence word by word even if you</text><text start="628.32" dur="4.959">translate it doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense</text><text start="630.8" dur="4.56">in your own language because the way you</text><text start="633.279" dur="4.401">tell it might be a different therefore</text><text start="635.36" dur="4.479">it&amp;#39;s important to focus on sentences</text><text start="637.68" dur="4.159">rather than the vocabularies after a</text><text start="639.839" dur="4.321">certain amount of time where you build a</text><text start="641.839" dur="4.801">bit of base for calories in your target</text><text start="644.16" dur="4.48">language when translating the sentences</text><text start="646.64" dur="4">start with simple sentences you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="648.64" dur="4.48">trying to learn from more complicated</text><text start="650.64" dur="4.8">sentences than make them simpler so let</text><text start="653.12" dur="5.2">me give you an example let&amp;#39;s translate</text><text start="655.44" dur="4.079">this sentence into turkish i don&amp;#39;t want</text><text start="658.32" dur="3.519">to have kids</text><text start="659.519" dur="4.401">because they cost a lot of money let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="661.839" dur="4">make this sentence firstly simpler first</text><text start="663.92" dur="4.4">sentence i don&amp;#39;t want to have kids</text><text start="665.839" dur="4.56">second sentence they cost a lot of money</text><text start="668.32" dur="4.32">so we make the sentences simpler and</text><text start="670.399" dur="4.56">let&amp;#39;s translate these sentences i don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="672.64" dur="4.8">want to have kids to stem they cost a</text><text start="674.959" dur="5.201">lot of money</text><text start="677.44" dur="5.12">now combine these two simple sentences</text><text start="680.16" dur="6.239">with a simple conjunction</text><text start="682.56" dur="3.839">so like because in turkish</text><text start="686.839" dur="4.041">chunky</text><text start="688.64" dur="4.4">i don&amp;#39;t want to have kids because they</text><text start="690.88" dur="4.32">cost a lot of money when translating</text><text start="693.04" dur="5.359">sentences the key is to make the</text><text start="695.2" dur="5.44">sentence simple as possible what really</text><text start="698.399" dur="4.321">communication is it&amp;#39;s not really about</text><text start="700.64" dur="4.56">the sophistication of your message or</text><text start="702.72" dur="5.04">how difficult vocabularies you use but</text><text start="705.2" dur="5.12">the ability to transfer the message you</text><text start="707.76" dur="4.56">would like to give right so talking in</text><text start="710.32" dur="4">simple sentences and simple vocabulary</text><text start="712.32" dur="3.84">is totally fine if the other side is</text><text start="714.32" dur="3.84">understanding you and if you&amp;#39;re able to</text><text start="716.16" dur="3.76">communicate then that&amp;#39;s fine so when</text><text start="718.16" dur="3.679">you&amp;#39;re speaking and if you feel like you</text><text start="719.92" dur="4.159">need to translate in your head stop</text><text start="721.839" dur="4.56">overwhelming and break down the</text><text start="724.079" dur="5.44">sentences in your head in the most</text><text start="726.399" dur="5.521">simple structure as possible and say</text><text start="729.519" dur="4.641">them separately and later on if you need</text><text start="731.92" dur="4.4">to add some details you can always add</text><text start="734.16" dur="5.6">them later on a lot of you guys might be</text><text start="736.32" dur="5.6">thinking when will i reach to this level</text><text start="739.76" dur="4.56">it will take you quite a long time to</text><text start="741.92" dur="4.24">reach to the level where you stop</text><text start="744.32" dur="3.84">translating in your head and thinking in</text><text start="746.16" dur="4.56">your target language you need to do a</text><text start="748.16" dur="5.119">massive input in your target language</text><text start="750.72" dur="6.08">you need to be exposed to that language</text><text start="753.279" dur="5.601">so much in order to be able to think in</text><text start="756.8" dur="4.88">that language just like a native speaker</text><text start="758.88" dur="5.68">in that language try to expose yourself</text><text start="761.68" dur="4.959">as much as possible into that language</text><text start="764.56" dur="3.92">for example reading books watching</text><text start="766.639" dur="3.841">youtube videos listening to podcasts</text><text start="768.48" dur="3.039">following newspapers reading online</text><text start="770.48" dur="3.28">articles</text><text start="771.519" dur="4.721">signing up to newsletters or something</text><text start="773.76" dur="4.96">there&amp;#39;s so many ways to do inputs these</text><text start="776.24" dur="5.44">days the more you integrate these in</text><text start="778.72" dur="5.28">your lifestyle in a daily part of yours</text><text start="781.68" dur="4.64">you&amp;#39;ll be more likely to think in that</text><text start="784" dur="4.639">language for example every single day i</text><text start="786.32" dur="4.8">listen german rap at least for 30</text><text start="788.639" dur="5.281">minutes in order not to forget german</text><text start="791.12" dur="5.2">and also i do business in english and i</text><text start="793.92" dur="4.88">talk with my dad in turkish and with my</text><text start="796.32" dur="3.759">mom in japanese and i also have turkish</text><text start="798.8" dur="3.599">and japanese friends and also</text><text start="800.079" dur="5.121">international friends so i use all of</text><text start="802.399" dur="5.201">these languages in a day and making this</text><text start="805.2" dur="4.879">a habit will allow you to firstly not</text><text start="807.6" dur="4.64">forget that language and also improve in</text><text start="810.079" dur="4.481">that language if you for example compare</text><text start="812.24" dur="4.24">my old videos to my current videos my</text><text start="814.56" dur="3.6">english actually improved quite a lot</text><text start="816.48" dur="3.68">i&amp;#39;m not saying that i&amp;#39;m like perfect in</text><text start="818.16" dur="4.96">english i sound like a native speaker</text><text start="820.16" dur="5.359">whatever but i&amp;#39;m able to sustain my life</text><text start="823.12" dur="4.24">while doing a business in my non-native</text><text start="825.519" dur="4.401">language which is i think it&amp;#39;s pretty</text><text start="827.36" dur="4.719">impressive when i was learning english i</text><text start="829.92" dur="4.4">was watching youtube videos six or seven</text><text start="832.079" dur="4.88">hours in a day so i was doing a massive</text><text start="834.32" dur="4.639">input in english and with the time it</text><text start="836.959" dur="4.401">took quite a long time like a year a</text><text start="838.959" dur="5.12">year and a half but after a bit of time</text><text start="841.36" dur="4.64">i slowly start to be able to think in</text><text start="844.079" dur="3.681">english and now when i&amp;#39;m like trying to</text><text start="846" dur="3.76">say something i don&amp;#39;t think in japanese</text><text start="847.76" dur="4.56">or turkish i just say it directly in</text><text start="849.76" dur="4.8">english and you know while i&amp;#39;m talking i</text><text start="852.32" dur="4.72">think in english but it&amp;#39;s due to the</text><text start="854.56" dur="4.24">massive input that i&amp;#39;ve done and also</text><text start="857.04" dur="3.52">that i&amp;#39;ve been doing you can learn in</text><text start="858.8" dur="3.76">languages just like having a lot of</text><text start="860.56" dur="3.44">conversation but in order to be able to</text><text start="862.56" dur="3.839">think in that language you need to be</text><text start="864" dur="4.399">more strategical so the conclusion will</text><text start="866.399" dur="3.921">be if you&amp;#39;re a beginner to that language</text><text start="868.399" dur="3.761">translating the vocabularies word by</text><text start="870.32" dur="3.92">word to your native language is</text><text start="872.16" dur="4.4">completely normal and it will allow you</text><text start="874.24" dur="4.88">to progress faster since you build the</text><text start="876.56" dur="5.279">vocabulary bank in your target language</text><text start="879.12" dur="4.8">you will require translation less and</text><text start="881.839" dur="4.161">less because from the sentence context</text><text start="883.92" dur="4.24">you will be able to understand the</text><text start="886" dur="4.16">meaning of the vocabulary or guess the</text><text start="888.16" dur="4.479">meaning of the vocabulary with the time</text><text start="890.16" dur="4.56">and from translating word by word it</text><text start="892.639" dur="4.401">will move on to the sentences which will</text><text start="894.72" dur="4.88">allow the process to be much faster</text><text start="897.04" dur="4.56">doing a massive input is important to be</text><text start="899.6" dur="4.239">able to reach to the level where you</text><text start="901.6" dur="4.239">think in your in that target language</text><text start="903.839" dur="3.761">but at the same time if you only do</text><text start="905.839" dur="4.24">inputs you will be able to understand</text><text start="907.6" dur="4">maybe but you might not be able to speak</text><text start="910.079" dur="3.681">i actually have a video about it which</text><text start="911.6" dur="4.08">you can watch here do massive inputs in</text><text start="913.76" dur="4">the beginning and then gradually start</text><text start="915.68" dur="4">to do outputs and then balance them</text><text start="917.76" dur="3.759">together so that you will be able to</text><text start="919.68" dur="4.159">understand think in that language and</text><text start="921.519" dur="4.961">also speak and write in that language i</text><text start="923.839" dur="6.881">hope you guys find this video valuable</text><text start="926.48" dur="4.24">and see you guys in my next video bye</text></transcript>

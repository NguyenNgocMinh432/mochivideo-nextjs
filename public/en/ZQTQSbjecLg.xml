sent by the Valar</text><text start="12.001" dur="2.273">to guide the inhabitants of Middle Earth</text><text start="14.298" dur="3.607">in their struggles
against the dark force of Sauron.</text><text start="17.929" dur="1.699">Gandalf&amp;#39;s body was mortal,</text><text start="19.652" dur="2.633">subject to the physical
rules of Middle Earth,</text><text start="22.309" dur="2.059">but his spirit was immortal,</text><text start="24.392" dur="2.381">as seen when he died as Gandalf the Grey</text><text start="26.797" dur="2.542">and resurrected as Gandalf the White.</text><text start="29.363" dur="2.144">According to the Wachowski&amp;#39;s script,</text><text start="31.531" dur="2.643">an awakened human only has to link up</text><text start="34.198" dur="3.354">and hack the neon binary
code of the Matrix</text><text start="37.576" dur="3.809">to learn how to fly a helicopter
in a matter of seconds.</text><text start="41.409" dur="2.895">Or if you are the One, or one of the Ones,</text><text start="44.328" dur="3.973">you don&amp;#39;t even need a helicopter,
you just need a cool pair of shades.</text><text start="49.388" dur="2.504">Cheshire cats can juggle their own heads.</text><text start="51.916" dur="2.155">iPads are rudimentary.</text><text start="54.465" dur="4.192">No Quidditch match ends
until the Golden Snitch is caught.</text><text start="58.681" dur="3.207">And the answer to the ultimate
question of life, the universe,</text><text start="61.912" dur="1.007">and everything</text><text start="62.943" dur="1.866">is most certainly 42.</text><text start="64.833" dur="3.284">Just like real life,
fictional worlds operate consistently</text><text start="68.141" dur="3.291">within a spectrum of physical
and societal rules.</text><text start="71.456" dur="1.905">That&amp;#39;s what makes these intricate worlds</text><text start="73.385" dur="3.078">believable, comprehensible,
and worth exploring.</text><text start="77.634" dur="4.134">In real life, the Law of Gravity
holds seven book sets of &amp;quot;Harry Potter&amp;quot;</text><text start="81.792" dur="2.322">to millions of bookshelves
around the world.</text><text start="84.138" dur="2.859">We know this to be true, but we also know</text><text start="87.021" dur="2.919">that ever since J.K. typed the words</text><text start="89.964" dur="3.274">wizard, wand, and &amp;quot;Wingardium Leviosa,&amp;quot;</text><text start="93.262" dur="2.728">that Law of Gravity has ceased to exist</text><text start="96.014" dur="3.517">on the trillions of pages
resting between those bookends.</text><text start="100.799" dur="3.854">Authors of science fiction and fantasy
literally build worlds.</text><text start="104.677" dur="2.587">They make rules, maps, lineages,</text><text start="107.288" dur="3.158">languages, cultures, universes,</text><text start="110.47" dur="2.562">alternate universes within universes,</text><text start="113.056" dur="3.978">and from those worlds sprout
story, after story, after story.</text><text start="117.058" dur="1.027">When it&amp;#39;s done well,</text><text start="118.109" dur="3.456">readers can understand
fictional worlds and their rules</text><text start="121.589" dur="2.936">just as well as the characters
that live in them do</text><text start="124.549" dur="2.566">and sometimes, just as well or even better</text><text start="127.139" dur="2.975">than the reader understands
the world outside of the book.</text><text start="131.304" dur="1">But how?</text><text start="132.328" dur="2.75">How can human-made squiggles on a page</text><text start="135.102" dur="3.914">reflect lights into our eyes
that send signals to our brains</text><text start="139.04" dur="4.554">that we logically and emotionally decode
as complex narratives</text><text start="143.618" dur="1.535">that move us to fight,</text><text start="145.177" dur="2.337">cry, sing, and think,</text><text start="147.538" dur="1.323">that are strong enough</text><text start="148.885" dur="1.89">not only to hold up a world</text><text start="150.799" dur="2.313">that is completely invented by the author,</text><text start="153.136" dur="3.337">but also to change
the reader&amp;#39;s perspective</text><text start="156.497" dur="2.276">on the real world that resumes</text><text start="158.797" dur="2.321">only when the final squiggle is reached?</text><text start="162.38" dur="2.668">I&amp;#39;m not sure anyone knows
the answer to that question,</text><text start="165.072" dur="3.727">yet fantastical, fictional worlds
are created everyday</text><text start="168.823" dur="1.89">in our minds, on computers,</text><text start="170.737" dur="3.141">even on napkins at the restaurant
down the street.</text><text start="173.902" dur="4.482">The truth is your imagination
and a willingness to, figuratively,</text><text start="178.408" dur="1.071">live in your own world</text><text start="179.503" dur="2.967">are all you need to get
started writing a novel.</text><text start="182.494" dur="3.13">I didn&amp;#39;t dream up Hogwarts
or the Star Wars&amp;#39; Cantina,</text><text start="185.648" dur="3.705">but I have written some science thrillers
for kids and young adults.</text><text start="189.377" dur="2.309">Here are some questions
and methods I&amp;#39;ve used</text><text start="191.71" dur="3.25">to help build the worlds
in which those books take place.</text><text start="196.088" dur="2.151">I start with a basic place and time.</text><text start="198.263" dur="4.025">Whether that&amp;#39;s a fantasy world
or a futuristic setting in the real world,</text><text start="202.312" dur="3.856">it&amp;#39;s important to know where you are
and whether you&amp;#39;re working in the past,</text><text start="206.192" dur="1.669">present, or future.</text><text start="207.885" dur="1.742">I like to create a timeline</text><text start="209.651" dur="2.133">showing how the world came to be.</text><text start="211.808" dur="3.063">What past events have shaped
the way it is now?</text><text start="214.895" dur="2.407">Then I brainstorm answers to questions</text><text start="217.326" dur="3.171">that draw out the details
of my fictional world.</text><text start="220.521" dur="1.972">What rules are in place here?</text><text start="222.517" dur="2.644">This covers everything
from laws of gravity,</text><text start="225.185" dur="1.078">or not,</text><text start="226.287" dur="1.127">to the rules of society</text><text start="227.438" dur="2.796">and the punishments
for individuals who break them.</text><text start="231.361" dur="2.152">What kind of government
does this world have?</text><text start="233.537" dur="2.116">Who has power, and who doesn&amp;#39;t?</text><text start="235.677" dur="2.327">What do people believe in here?</text><text start="238.028" dur="2.909">And what does this society value most?</text><text start="240.961" dur="2.624">Then it&amp;#39;s time to think
about day-to-day life.</text><text start="243.609" dur="2.142">What&amp;#39;s the weather like in this world?</text><text start="245.775" dur="3.31">Where do the inhabitants live
and work and go to school?</text><text start="249.109" dur="1.002">What do they eat</text><text start="250.135" dur="1.27">and how do they play?</text><text start="251.429" dur="2.404">How do they treat their young
and their old?</text><text start="253.857" dur="3.896">What relationships do they have
with the animals and plants of the world?</text><text start="257.777" dur="2.598">And what do those animals
and plants look like?</text><text start="260.399" dur="2.704">What kind of technology exists?</text><text start="263.127" dur="1.006">Transportation?</text><text start="264.157" dur="1.008">Communication?</text><text start="265.189" dur="1.74">Access to information?</text><text start="266.953" dur="2.349">There&amp;#39;s so much to think about!</text><text start="269.326" dur="4.528">So, spend some time living in those tasks
and the answers to those questions,</text><text start="273.878" dur="3.701">and you&amp;#39;re well on your way
to building your own fictional world.</text><text start="277.603" dur="3.256">Once you know your world
as well as you hope your reader will,</text><text start="280.883" dur="3.791">set your characters free in it
and see what happens.</text><text start="284.698" dur="1.195">And ask yourself,</text><text start="285.917" dur="4.517">&amp;quot;How does this world you created
shape the individuals who live in it?</text><text start="290.458" dur="3.329">And what kind of conflict
is likely to emerge?&amp;quot;</text><text start="293.811" dur="3.209">Answer those questions,
and you have your story.</text><text start="297.044" dur="1.981">Good luck, future world-builder!</text></transcript>

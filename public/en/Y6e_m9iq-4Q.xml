<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="6.83" dur="3.594">Have you ever noticed something swimming
in your field of vision?</text><text start="10.448" dur="3.613">It may look like a tiny worm
or a transparent blob,</text><text start="14.085" dur="3.967">and whenever you try to get
a closer look, it disappears,</text><text start="18.076" dur="2.687">only to reappear
as soon as you shift your glance.</text><text start="21.727" dur="2.065">But don&amp;#39;t go rinsing out your eyes!</text><text start="23.816" dur="2.577">What you are seeing is a common phenomenon</text><text start="26.417" dur="1.032">known as a floater.</text><text start="28.451" dur="4.142">The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes,</text><text start="32.616" dur="2.139">Latin for &amp;quot;flying flies,&amp;quot;</text><text start="34.779" dur="3.13">and true to their name,
they can be somewhat annoying.</text><text start="37.933" dur="4.112">But they&amp;#39;re not actually bugs
or any kind of external objects at all.</text><text start="42.069" dur="2.262">Rather, they exist inside your eyeball.</text><text start="45.209" dur="3.533">Floaters may seem to be alive,
since they move and change shape,</text><text start="48.766" dur="1.247">but they are not alive.</text><text start="50.832" dur="3.817">Floaters are tiny objects
that cast shadows on the retina,</text><text start="54.673" dur="2.555">the light-sensitive tissue
at the back of your eye.</text><text start="58.077" dur="1.513">They might be bits of tissue,</text><text start="59.614" dur="1.108">red blood cells,</text><text start="60.746" dur="1.935">or clumps of protein.</text><text start="62.705" dur="3.501">And because they&amp;#39;re suspended
within the vitreous humor,</text><text start="66.23" dur="3.047">the gel-like liquid
that fills the inside of your eye,</text><text start="69.301" dur="2.279">floaters drift along
with your eye movements,</text><text start="71.604" dur="2.727">and seem to bounce a little
when your eye stops.</text><text start="75.291" dur="3.241">Floaters may be only
barely distinguishable most of the time.</text><text start="79.46" dur="3.251">They become more visible
the closer they are to the retina,</text><text start="82.735" dur="3.482">just as holding your hand closer
to a table with an overhead light</text><text start="86.241" dur="2.486">will result in a more
sharply defined shadow.</text><text start="89.555" dur="2.025">And floaters are particularly noticeable</text><text start="91.604" dur="2.978">when you are looking
at a uniform bright surface,</text><text start="94.606" dur="1.613">like a blank computer screen,</text><text start="96.243" dur="1.203">snow,</text><text start="97.47" dur="1.344">or a clear sky,</text><text start="98.838" dur="4.245">where the consistency of the background
makes them easier to distinguish.</text><text start="103.107" dur="3.654">The brighter the light is,
the more your pupil contracts.</text><text start="106.785" dur="3.913">This has an effect similar
to replacing a large diffuse light fixture</text><text start="110.722" dur="2.296">with a single overhead light bulb,</text><text start="113.042" dur="2.281">which also makes
the shadow appear clearer.</text><text start="116.189" dur="3.555">There is another visual phenomenon
that looks similar to floaters</text><text start="119.768" dur="1.551">but is in fact unrelated.</text><text start="122.382" dur="2.378">If you&amp;#39;ve seen tiny dots of light
darting about</text><text start="124.784" dur="2.193">when looking at a bright blue sky,</text><text start="127.001" dur="4.097">you&amp;#39;ve experienced what is known
as the blue field entoptic phenomenon.</text><text start="132.273" dur="2.867">In some ways,
this is the opposite of seeing floaters.</text><text start="135.947" dur="1.631">Here, you are not seeing shadows</text><text start="137.602" dur="3.426">but little moving windows
letting light through to your retina.</text><text start="141.982" dur="2.814">The windows are actually caused
by white blood cells</text><text start="144.82" dur="3.066">moving through the capillaries
along your retina&amp;#39;s surface.</text><text start="148.696" dur="4.057">These leukocytes can be so large
that they nearly fill a capillary</text><text start="152.777" dur="3.13">causing a plasma space
to open up in front of them.</text><text start="157.132" dur="2.01">Because the space
and the white blood cells</text><text start="159.166" dur="2.53">are both more transparent to blue light</text><text start="161.72" dur="3.241">than the red blood cells
normally present in capillaries,</text><text start="164.985" dur="3.056">we see a moving dot of light
wherever this happens,</text><text start="168.065" dur="3.859">following the paths of your capillaries
and moving in time with your pulse.</text><text start="172.829" dur="1.957">Under ideal viewing conditions,</text><text start="174.81" dur="4.102">you might even see what looks
like a dark tail following the dot.</text><text start="178.936" dur="3.642">This is the red blood cells
that have bunched up behind the leukocyte.</text><text start="183.428" dur="4.251">Some science museums have an exhibit
which consists of a screen of blue light,</text><text start="187.703" dur="4.539">allowing you to see these blue sky sprites
much more clearly than you normally would.</text><text start="193.195" dur="3">While everybody&amp;#39;s eyes experience
these sort of effects,</text><text start="196.219" dur="2.58">the number and type vary greatly.</text><text start="198.823" dur="1.492">In the case of floaters,</text><text start="200.339" dur="3.148">they often go unnoticed,
as our brain learns to ignore them.</text><text start="204.311" dur="2.024">However, abnormally numerous</text><text start="206.359" dur="2.686">or large floaters
that interfere with vision</text><text start="209.069" dur="4.595">may be a sign of a more serious condition,
requiring immediate medical treatment.</text><text start="214.569" dur="3.028">But the majority of the time
entoptic phenomena,</text><text start="217.621" dur="2.589">such as floaters and blue sky sprites,</text><text start="220.234" dur="3.389">are just a gentle reminder
that what we think we see</text><text start="223.647" dur="3.119">depends just as much
on our biology and minds</text><text start="226.79" dur="2.254">as it does on the external world.</text></transcript>

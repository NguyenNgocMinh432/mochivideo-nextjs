<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="13.24" dur="2.56">A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.</text><text start="16.88" dur="1.216">I had just driven home,</text><text start="18.12" dur="2.536">it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,</text><text start="20.68" dur="2.296">I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,</text><text start="23" dur="4.776">and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --</text><text start="27.8" dur="3.096">and don&amp;#39;t bother asking
if that&amp;#39;s Celsius or Fahrenheit,</text><text start="30.92" dur="2.456">minus 40 is where the two scales meet --</text><text start="33.4" dur="1.256">it was very cold.</text><text start="34.68" dur="3.216">And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,</text><text start="37.92" dur="2.256">I found I didn&amp;#39;t have my keys.</text><text start="40.2" dur="2.096">In fact, I could see them
through the window,</text><text start="42.32" dur="3.096">lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.</text><text start="45.44" dur="3.136">So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,</text><text start="48.6" dur="1.576">and they were locked tight.</text><text start="50.2" dur="3.143">I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,</text><text start="53.367" dur="3.329">but at midnight, it could take a while
for a locksmith to show up,</text><text start="56.72" dur="2.16">and it was cold.</text><text start="60.421" dur="2.715">I couldn&amp;#39;t go back to my friend
Jeff&amp;#39;s house for the night</text><text start="63.16" dur="2.667">because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,</text><text start="65.851" dur="2.239">and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.</text><text start="68.4" dur="2.496">So, desperate and freezing cold,</text><text start="70.92" dur="3.616">I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,</text><text start="74.56" dur="1.976">cleared out the shards of glass,</text><text start="76.56" dur="1.336">I crawled through,</text><text start="77.92" dur="3.416">I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,</text><text start="81.36" dur="2.62">figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,</text><text start="84.004" dur="2.772">I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.</text><text start="86.8" dur="1.477">This was going to be expensive,</text><text start="88.301" dur="3.555">but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,</text><text start="91.88" dur="4.16">so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.</text><text start="96.92" dur="2.176">Now, I&amp;#39;m a neuroscientist by training</text><text start="99.12" dur="4.096">and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.</text><text start="103.24" dur="3.536">It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,</text><text start="106.8" dur="2.256">it modulates adrenaline levels</text><text start="109.08" dur="1.48">and it clouds your thinking.</text><text start="111.08" dur="1.976">So the next morning,</text><text start="113.08" dur="2.456">when I woke up on too little sleep,</text><text start="115.56" dur="2.736">worrying about the hole in the window,</text><text start="118.32" dur="2.776">and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,</text><text start="121.12" dur="1.696">and the freezing temperatures,</text><text start="122.84" dur="2.456">and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,</text><text start="125.32" dur="3.536">and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,</text><text start="128.88" dur="1.376">my thinking was cloudy,</text><text start="130.28" dur="3.416">but I didn&amp;#39;t know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.</text><text start="133.72" dur="1.496">(Laughter)</text><text start="135.24" dur="3.256">And it wasn&amp;#39;t until I got
to the airport check-in counter,</text><text start="138.52" dur="2.256">that I realized I didn&amp;#39;t have my passport.</text><text start="140.8" dur="2.016">(Laughter)</text><text start="142.84" dur="3.456">So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,</text><text start="146.32" dur="2.456">got my passport,
raced back to the airport,</text><text start="148.8" dur="1.816">I made it just in time,</text><text start="150.64" dur="2.239">but they had given away
my seat to someone else,</text><text start="152.903" dur="2.976">so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,</text><text start="155.903" dur="3.217">in a seat that wouldn&amp;#39;t recline,
on an eight-hour flight.</text><text start="159.88" dur="3.456">Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.</text><text start="163.36" dur="1.136">(Laughter)</text><text start="164.52" dur="2.656">And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,</text><text start="167.2" dur="1.936">systems that I can put into place,</text><text start="169.16" dur="2.456">that will prevent bad things
from happening?</text><text start="171.64" dur="1.896">Or at least if bad things happen,</text><text start="173.56" dur="5">will minimize the likelihood
of it being a total catastrophe.</text><text start="179.36" dur="1.576">So I started thinking about that,</text><text start="180.96" dur="2.858">but my thoughts didn&amp;#39;t crystallize
until about a month later.</text><text start="183.842" dur="3.694">I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,</text><text start="187.56" dur="3.376">and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,</text><text start="190.96" dur="2.416">and, you know, forgotten my passport,</text><text start="193.4" dur="1.216">and Danny shared with me</text><text start="194.64" dur="4.496">that he&amp;#39;d been practicing
something called prospective hindsight.</text><text start="199.16" dur="1.736">(Laughter)</text><text start="200.92" dur="3.143">It&amp;#39;s something that he had gotten
from the psychologist Gary Klein,</text><text start="204.087" dur="2.049">who had written about it
a few years before,</text><text start="206.16" dur="2.096">also called the pre-mortem.</text><text start="208.28" dur="1.953">Now, you all know what the postmortem is.</text><text start="210.257" dur="1.479">Whenever there&amp;#39;s a disaster,</text><text start="211.76" dur="4.296">a team of experts come in and they try
to figure out what went wrong, right?</text><text start="216.08" dur="2.416">Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,</text><text start="218.52" dur="3.896">you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,</text><text start="222.44" dur="2.576">and then you try to figure out
what you can do</text><text start="225.04" dur="3.496">to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.</text><text start="228.56" dur="2.936">So what I want to talk to you about today</text><text start="231.52" dur="3.536">are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.</text><text start="235.08" dur="2.896">Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.</text><text start="238" dur="1.936">I&amp;#39;ll start with the obvious ones.</text><text start="239.96" dur="5.08">Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.</text><text start="245.68" dur="3.856">Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,</text><text start="249.56" dur="2.536">but there&amp;#39;s a lot of science
to back this up,</text><text start="252.12" dur="3.296">based on the way our spatial memory works.</text><text start="255.44" dur="2.856">There&amp;#39;s a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,</text><text start="258.32" dur="2.936">that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,</text><text start="261.28" dur="3.776">to keep track of the locations
of important things --</text><text start="265.08" dur="2.416">where the well is,
where fish can be found,</text><text start="267.52" dur="2.496">that stand of fruit trees,</text><text start="270.04" dur="2.616">where the friendly and enemy tribes live.</text><text start="272.68" dur="1.905">The hippocampus is the part of the brain</text><text start="274.609" dur="3.487">that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.</text><text start="278.12" dur="3.696">It&amp;#39;s the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.</text><text start="281.84" dur="2.858">And if you&amp;#39;re wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment</text><text start="284.722" dur="2.774">where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,</text><text start="287.52" dur="1.816">and they could still find their nuts.</text><text start="289.36" dur="2.816">They weren&amp;#39;t using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,</text><text start="292.2" dur="5.016">this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.</text><text start="297.24" dur="3.736">But it&amp;#39;s really good for things
that don&amp;#39;t move around much,</text><text start="301" dur="2.456">not so good for things that move around.</text><text start="303.48" dur="4.296">So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.</text><text start="307.8" dur="2.496">So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --</text><text start="310.32" dur="2.856">a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.</text><text start="313.2" dur="2.096">For your passport, a particular drawer.</text><text start="315.32" dur="2.776">For your reading glasses,
a particular table.</text><text start="318.12" dur="3.456">If you designate a spot
and you&amp;#39;re scrupulous about it,</text><text start="321.6" dur="2.816">your things will always be there
when you look for them.</text><text start="324.44" dur="1.216">What about travel?</text><text start="325.68" dur="2.376">Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,</text><text start="328.08" dur="2.296">your driver&amp;#39;s license, your passport,</text><text start="330.4" dur="2.256">mail it to yourself so it&amp;#39;s in the cloud.</text><text start="332.68" dur="4.376">If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.</text><text start="337.08" dur="2.616">Now these are some rather obvious things.</text><text start="339.72" dur="3.536">Remember, when you&amp;#39;re under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.</text><text start="343.28" dur="3.216">Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.</text><text start="346.52" dur="2.536">So part of the practice of the pre-mortem</text><text start="349.08" dur="4.256">is to recognize that under stress
you&amp;#39;re not going to be at your best,</text><text start="353.36" dur="2.296">and you should put systems in place.</text><text start="355.68" dur="2.936">And there&amp;#39;s perhaps
no more stressful a situation</text><text start="358.64" dur="3.416">than when you&amp;#39;re confronted
with a medical decision to make.</text><text start="362.08" dur="3.296">And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,</text><text start="365.4" dur="2.376">where we have to make
a very important decision</text><text start="367.8" dur="3.296">about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,</text><text start="371.12" dur="1.656">to help them with a decision.</text><text start="372.8" dur="1.616">And so I want to talk about that.</text><text start="374.44" dur="3.016">And I&amp;#39;m going to talk about
a very particular medical condition.</text><text start="377.48" dur="3.536">But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
of medical decision-making,</text><text start="381.04" dur="4.016">and indeed for financial decision-making,
and social decision-making --</text><text start="385.08" dur="2.256">any kind of decision you have to make</text><text start="387.36" dur="4.016">that would benefit from a rational
assessment of the facts.</text><text start="391.4" dur="3.136">So suppose you go to your doctor
and the doctor says,</text><text start="394.56" dur="4.12">&amp;quot;I just got your lab work back,
your cholesterol&amp;#39;s a little high.&amp;quot;</text><text start="399.24" dur="3.016">Now, you all know that high cholesterol</text><text start="402.28" dur="4.136">is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,</text><text start="406.44" dur="1.416">heart attack, stroke.</text><text start="407.88" dur="1.216">And so you&amp;#39;re thinking</text><text start="409.12" dur="2.096">having high cholesterol
isn&amp;#39;t the best thing,</text><text start="411.24" dur="3.016">and so the doctor says,
&amp;quot;You know, I&amp;#39;d like to give you a drug</text><text start="414.28" dur="2.776">that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin.&amp;quot;</text><text start="417.08" dur="1.896">And you&amp;#39;ve probably heard of statins,</text><text start="419" dur="2.81">you know that they&amp;#39;re among
the most widely prescribed drugs</text><text start="421.834" dur="1.174">in the world today,</text><text start="423.032" dur="2.079">you probably even know
people who take them.</text><text start="425.135" dur="2.381">And so you&amp;#39;re thinking,
&amp;quot;Yeah! Give me the statin.&amp;quot;</text><text start="427.541" dur="2.435">But there&amp;#39;s a question
you should ask at this point,</text><text start="430" dur="1.856">a statistic you should ask for</text><text start="431.88" dur="2.456">that most doctors
don&amp;#39;t like talking about,</text><text start="434.36" dur="3.16">and pharmaceutical companies
like talking about even less.</text><text start="438.8" dur="2.376">It&amp;#39;s for the number needed to treat.</text><text start="441.2" dur="1.976">Now, what is this, the NNT?</text><text start="443.2" dur="3.056">It&amp;#39;s the number of people
that need to take a drug</text><text start="446.28" dur="2.856">or undergo a surgery
or any medical procedure</text><text start="449.16" dur="2.376">before one person is helped.</text><text start="451.56" dur="2.856">And you&amp;#39;re thinking,
what kind of crazy statistic is that?</text><text start="454.44" dur="1.216">The number should be one.</text><text start="455.68" dur="2.056">My doctor wouldn&amp;#39;t prescribe
something to me</text><text start="457.76" dur="1.285">if it&amp;#39;s not going to help.</text><text start="459.069" dur="2.484">But actually, medical practice
doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.</text><text start="461.578" dur="1.531">And it&amp;#39;s not the doctor&amp;#39;s fault,</text><text start="463.134" dur="2.919">if it&amp;#39;s anybody&amp;#39;s fault,
it&amp;#39;s the fault of scientists like me.</text><text start="466.077" dur="2.865">We haven&amp;#39;t figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.</text><text start="468.966" dur="2.41">But GlaxoSmithKline estimates</text><text start="471.4" dur="4.976">that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.</text><text start="476.4" dur="3.816">So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,</text><text start="480.24" dur="2.136">what do you suppose it is?</text><text start="482.4" dur="2.816">How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?</text><text start="485.24" dur="1.2">300.</text><text start="487.075" dur="1.381">This is according to research</text><text start="488.48" dur="3.496">by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,</text><text start="492" dur="2.776">independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.</text><text start="494.8" dur="2.4">I ran through the numbers myself.</text><text start="497.92" dur="2.376">300 people have to
take the drug for a year</text><text start="500.32" dur="3.976">before one heart attack, stroke
or other adverse event is prevented.</text><text start="504.32" dur="1.381">Now you&amp;#39;re probably thinking,</text><text start="505.725" dur="2.811">&amp;quot;Well, OK, one in 300 chance
of lowering my cholesterol.</text><text start="508.56" dur="2.216">Why not, doc? Give me
the prescription anyway.&amp;quot;</text><text start="510.8" dur="2.856">But you should ask at this point
for another statistic,</text><text start="513.68" dur="2.576">and that is, &amp;quot;Tell me
about the side effects.&amp;quot; Right?</text><text start="516.28" dur="1.656">So for this particular drug,</text><text start="517.96" dur="3.656">the side effects occur
in five percent of the patients.</text><text start="521.64" dur="1.667">And they include terrible things --</text><text start="523.331" dur="4.444">debilitating muscle and joint pain,
gastrointestinal distress --</text><text start="527.799" dur="1.859">but now you&amp;#39;re thinking, &amp;quot;Five percent,</text><text start="529.682" dur="2.014">not very likely
it&amp;#39;s going to happen to me,</text><text start="531.72" dur="1.238">I&amp;#39;ll still take the drug.&amp;quot;</text><text start="532.982" dur="1.194">But wait a minute.</text><text start="534.2" dur="2.336">Remember under stress
you&amp;#39;re not thinking clearly.</text><text start="536.56" dur="3.165">So think about how you&amp;#39;re going
to work through this ahead of time,</text><text start="539.75" dur="3.198">so you don&amp;#39;t have to manufacture
the chain of reasoning on the spot.</text><text start="542.973" dur="2.492">300 people take the drug, right?
One person&amp;#39;s helped,</text><text start="545.489" dur="2.407">five percent of those 300
have side effects,</text><text start="547.92" dur="1.48">that&amp;#39;s 15 people.</text><text start="549.8" dur="3.896">You&amp;#39;re 15 times more likely
to be harmed by the drug</text><text start="553.72" dur="2.816">than you are to be helped by the drug.</text><text start="556.56" dur="2.905">Now, I&amp;#39;m not saying whether you
should take the statin or not.</text><text start="559.489" dur="3.143">I&amp;#39;m just saying you should have
this conversation with your doctor.</text><text start="562.656" dur="1.32">Medical ethics requires it,</text><text start="564" dur="2.296">it&amp;#39;s part of the principle
of informed consent.</text><text start="566.32" dur="3.216">You have the right to have access
to this kind of information</text><text start="569.56" dur="3.896">to begin the conversation about whether
you want to take the risks or not.</text><text start="573.48" dur="1.216">Now you might be thinking</text><text start="574.72" dur="2.696">I&amp;#39;ve pulled this number
out of the air for shock value,</text><text start="577.44" dur="3.256">but in fact it&amp;#39;s rather typical,
this number needed to treat.</text><text start="580.72" dur="4.616">For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,</text><text start="585.36" dur="2.216">removal of the prostate for cancer,</text><text start="587.6" dur="2.576">the number needed to treat is 49.</text><text start="590.2" dur="4.176">That&amp;#39;s right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who&amp;#39;s helped.</text><text start="594.4" dur="4.656">And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.</text><text start="599.08" dur="2.856">They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,</text><text start="601.96" dur="2.776">urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,</text><text start="604.76" dur="1.456">fecal incontinence.</text><text start="606.24" dur="3.496">And if you&amp;#39;re lucky, and you&amp;#39;re one
of the 50 percent who has these,</text><text start="609.76" dur="2.04">they&amp;#39;ll only last for a year or two.</text><text start="612.88" dur="3.616">So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time</text><text start="616.52" dur="2.536">to the questions
that you might be able to ask</text><text start="619.08" dur="2.376">that will push the conversation forward.</text><text start="621.48" dur="3.096">You don&amp;#39;t want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.</text><text start="624.6" dur="2.896">And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.</text><text start="627.52" dur="1.776">Because you have a choice oftentimes,</text><text start="629.32" dur="2.296">do you I want a shorter life
that&amp;#39;s pain-free,</text><text start="631.64" dur="3.776">or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?</text><text start="635.44" dur="2.416">These are things to talk about
and think about now,</text><text start="637.88" dur="1.816">with your family and your loved ones.</text><text start="639.72" dur="2.496">You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,</text><text start="642.24" dur="3.056">but at least you&amp;#39;re practiced
with this kind of thinking.</text><text start="645.32" dur="4.616">Remember, our brain under stress
releases cortisol,</text><text start="649.96" dur="2.336">and one of the things
that happens at that moment</text><text start="652.32" dur="1.936">is a whole bunch on systems shut down.</text><text start="654.28" dur="1.905">There&amp;#39;s an evolutionary reason for this.</text><text start="656.209" dur="3.407">Face-to-face with a predator,
you don&amp;#39;t need your digestive system,</text><text start="659.64" dur="2.456">or your libido, or your immune system,</text><text start="662.12" dur="3.656">because if you&amp;#39;re body is expending
metabolism on those things</text><text start="665.8" dur="1.656">and you don&amp;#39;t react quickly,</text><text start="667.48" dur="3.976">you might become the lion&amp;#39;s lunch,
and then none of those things matter.</text><text start="671.48" dur="1.416">Unfortunately,</text><text start="672.92" dur="3.616">one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress</text><text start="676.56" dur="1.976">is rational, logical thinking,</text><text start="678.56" dur="3.416">as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.</text><text start="682" dur="3.176">So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead</text><text start="685.2" dur="2.256">to these kinds of situations.</text><text start="687.48" dur="6.176">I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.</text><text start="693.68" dur="2.856">We all are going to fail now and then.</text><text start="696.56" dur="3.616">The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,</text><text start="700.2" dur="3.896">to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,</text><text start="704.12" dur="3.52">or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.</text><text start="708.28" dur="2.656">Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,</text><text start="710.96" dur="1.736">when I got back from my trip,</text><text start="712.72" dur="3.856">I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,</text><text start="716.6" dur="3.536">with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.</text><text start="720.16" dur="1.216">And I have to admit,</text><text start="721.4" dur="3.416">I still have piles of mail
that haven&amp;#39;t been sorted,</text><text start="724.84" dur="2.576">and piles of emails
that I haven&amp;#39;t gone through.</text><text start="727.44" dur="1.776">So I&amp;#39;m not completely organized,</text><text start="729.24" dur="3.136">but I see organization
as a gradual process,</text><text start="732.4" dur="1.216">and I&amp;#39;m getting there.</text><text start="733.64" dur="1.216">Thank you very much.</text><text start="734.88" dur="4.392">(Applause)</text></transcript>

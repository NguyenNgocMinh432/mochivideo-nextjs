<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.46" dur="4.401">For thousands of years people have practiced
meditation for spiritual, emotional, and physical</text><text start="4.861" dur="1">well being.</text><text start="5.861" dur="4.01">But from a scientific perspective, how exactly
does meditating affect your body?</text><text start="9.871" dur="1.89">Does it really do anything?</text><text start="11.761" dur="1.19">It all starts in the brain!</text><text start="12.951" dur="5.07">During meditation, brain-scans see increased
activity in regions directly correlated with</text><text start="18.021" dur="3.15">decreased anxiety and depression, along with
increased pain tolerance.</text><text start="21.171" dur="4.32">The Default Mode Network, in particular, is
activated when one’s mind is at rest and</text><text start="25.491" dur="4.04">not focusing on the outside world, and has
been found to improve memory, self awareness</text><text start="29.531" dur="1">and goal setting.</text><text start="30.531" dur="2.26">Want to be more caring to your friends and
family?</text><text start="32.791" dur="4.06">When scientists compared the brains of Buddhist
monks to new meditators, they found the region</text><text start="36.851" dur="4.07">of the brain associated with empathy to be
much more pronounced in the monks.</text><text start="40.921" dur="4.689">It also literally changes your brain waves
- and we can measure these frequencies.</text><text start="45.61" dur="3.521">Meditators have higher levels of Alpha waves,
which have been shown to reduce feelings of</text><text start="49.131" dur="2.9">negative mood, tension, sadness and anger.</text><text start="52.031" dur="4.27">And if that wasn’t enough, it also physically
changes our brain shape and size.</text><text start="56.301" dur="4.359">Studies found that after 8 weeks of a meditation
program, gray matter was more dense in areas</text><text start="60.66" dur="3.831">associated with learning, memory processing,
and emotion regulation.</text><text start="64.491" dur="4.22">And yet the amygdala, which deals with stress,
blood pressure and fear, had decreased gray</text><text start="68.711" dur="1">matter!</text><text start="69.711" dur="3.54">When we look at the entire body, not only
do we see decreased blood pressure, but it</text><text start="73.251" dur="2.88">can also increase the variability of your
heart rate.</text><text start="76.131" dur="3.68">While this may sound harmful, it actually
plays a critical role in properly transporting</text><text start="79.811" dur="2.61">Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide throughout your
body.</text><text start="82.421" dur="1">Think your getting sick?</text><text start="83.421" dur="4.46">In a study where both meditators and non-mediators
were given the flu virus, meditators were</text><text start="87.881" dur="4.25">able to produce a greater number of antibodies
and had increased immune function.</text><text start="92.131" dur="3.55">If we go a little deeper, we can even see
changes on a cellular level.</text><text start="95.681" dur="4.12">Your chromosomes have protective protein complexes
called telomeres, which help reduce damage</text><text start="99.801" dur="2.34">to your DNA and lower cell death.</text><text start="102.141" dur="3.84">And a shortened telomere length has been linked
to several disease such as cardiovascular</text><text start="105.981" dur="2.8">disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and cancer.</text><text start="108.781" dur="4.06">Amazingly, when cancer survivors completed
a meditation program, their bodies showed</text><text start="112.841" dur="2.22">significant increases in telomere length.</text><text start="115.061" dur="4.57">It’s believed that psychological intervention,
particularly decreasing stress, has a direct</text><text start="119.631" dur="4.32">effect on the enzyme telomerase, which has
been shown to counteract shortening by adding</text><text start="123.951" dur="1.74">DNA to the shrinking telomeres.</text><text start="125.691" dur="4.65">Of course, meditation is not a substitute
for other medical advice or a healthy lifestyle</text><text start="130.341" dur="3.23">- we don’t want you leaving this video thinking
it will cure cancer.</text><text start="133.571" dur="3.49">But much like hitting the gym can grow your
muscles and increase your overall health,</text><text start="137.061" dur="4.2">it seems that meditation may be a way of ‘working
out’ your brain with extra health benefits.</text><text start="141.261" dur="5.52">And since your brain controls, well...all
of you, why not relax and say ‘om’ every</text><text start="146.781" dur="1.06">once in a while.</text><text start="147.841" dur="3.28">And if you like working out your brain, be

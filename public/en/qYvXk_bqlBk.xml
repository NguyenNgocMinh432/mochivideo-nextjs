group of individuals you are ...</text><text start="17.505" dur="1.448">to a psychologist.</text><text start="18.977" dur="1.439">(Laughter)</text><text start="20.44" dur="3.106">I&amp;#39;ve had the opportunity
over the last couple of days</text><text start="23.57" dur="2.586">of listening in on some
of your conversations</text><text start="26.984" dur="2.166">and watching you interact with each other.</text><text start="29.174" dur="2.525">And I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say, already,</text><text start="31.723" dur="5.188">that there are 47 people in this audience,</text><text start="37.494" dur="1.218">at this moment,</text><text start="39.414" dur="4.133">displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today.</text><text start="43.571" dur="1.347">(Laughter)</text><text start="44.942" dur="3.002">And I thought you might
like to know who you are.</text><text start="47.968" dur="1.423">(Laughter)</text><text start="49.415" dur="1.687">But instead of pointing at you,</text><text start="51.126" dur="3.198">which would be gratuitous and intrusive,</text><text start="54.865" dur="3.001">I thought I would tell you
a few facts and stories,</text><text start="57.89" dur="3.037">in which you may catch
a glimpse of yourself.</text><text start="62.089" dur="4.236">I&amp;#39;m in the field of research
known as personality psychology,</text><text start="66.349" dur="3.44">which is part of a larger
personality science</text><text start="69.813" dur="5.109">which spans the full spectrum,
from neurons to narratives.</text><text start="75.337" dur="1.453">And what we try to do,</text><text start="77.601" dur="1.563">in our own way,</text><text start="79.188" dur="2.744">is to make sense of how each of us --</text><text start="82.793" dur="1.226">each of you --</text><text start="84.467" dur="2.078">is, in certain respects,</text><text start="86.569" dur="1.363">like all other people,</text><text start="88.993" dur="1.384">like some other people</text><text start="91.243" dur="2.018">and like no other person.</text><text start="94.579" dur="3.167">Now, already you may
be saying of yourself,</text><text start="97.77" dur="1.745">&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not intriguing.</text><text start="101.597" dur="5.449">I am the 46th most boring person
in the Western Hemisphere.&amp;quot;</text><text start="107.895" dur="2.289">Or you may say of yourself,</text><text start="110.208" dur="1.907">&amp;quot;I am intriguing,</text><text start="113.252" dur="3.951">even if I am regarded by most people
as a great, thundering twit.&amp;quot;</text><text start="117.227" dur="1.19">(Laughter)</text><text start="118.441" dur="5.86">But it is your self-diagnosed boringness
and your inherent &amp;quot;twitiness&amp;quot;</text><text start="124.325" dur="4.427">that makes me, as a psychologist,
really fascinated by you.</text><text start="129.172" dur="2.351">So let me explain why this is so.</text><text start="132.284" dur="4.161">One of the most influential approaches
in personality science</text><text start="136.469" dur="1.59">is known as trait psychology,</text><text start="138.083" dur="5.369">and it aligns you along five dimensions
which are normally distributed,</text><text start="143.476" dur="6.99">and that describe universally held aspects
of difference between people.</text><text start="151.379" dur="2.329">They spell out the acronym OCEAN.</text><text start="154.105" dur="3.051">So, &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;open to experience,&amp;quot;</text><text start="157.18" dur="2.351">versus those who are more closed.</text><text start="159.555" dur="3.175">&amp;quot;C&amp;quot; stands for &amp;quot;conscientiousness,&amp;quot;</text><text start="162.754" dur="3.644">in contrast to those with a more
lackadaisical approach to life.</text><text start="166.422" dur="4.643">&amp;quot;E&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;extroversion,&amp;quot; in contrast
to more introverted people.</text><text start="171.089" dur="2.692">&amp;quot;A&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;agreeable individuals,&amp;quot;</text><text start="173.805" dur="3.422">in contrast to those
decidedly not agreeable.</text><text start="177.599" dur="2.644">And &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; -- &amp;quot;neurotic individuals,&amp;quot;</text><text start="180.267" dur="2.673">in contrast to those who are more stable.</text><text start="184.268" dur="3.39">All of these dimensions have
implications for our well-being,</text><text start="187.682" dur="2.506">for how our life goes.</text><text start="190.762" dur="2.349">And so we know that, for example,</text><text start="193.135" dur="4.975">openness and conscientiousness
are very good predictors of life success,</text><text start="198.829" dur="4.377">but the open people achieve that success
through being audacious</text><text start="203.23" dur="2.178">and, occasionally, odd.</text><text start="206.077" dur="4.365">The conscientious people
achieve it through sticking to deadlines,</text><text start="210.466" dur="3.922">to persevering, as well as
having some passion.</text><text start="215.662" dur="3.886">Extroversion and agreeableness
are both conducive</text><text start="219.572" dur="2.578">to working well with people.</text><text start="222.866" dur="2.988">Extroverts, for example,
I find intriguing.</text><text start="225.878" dur="2.983">With my classes, I sometimes
give them a basic fact</text><text start="228.885" dur="2.967">that might be revealing
with respect to their personality:</text><text start="232.356" dur="5.046">I tell them that it is virtually
impossible for adults</text><text start="237.426" dur="3.837">to lick the outside of their own elbow.</text><text start="241.287" dur="1.254">(Laughter)</text><text start="242.565" dur="1.384">Did you know that?</text><text start="245.505" dur="4.189">Already, some of you have tried
to lick the outside of your own elbow.</text><text start="249.718" dur="1.776">But extroverts amongst you</text><text start="251.518" dur="2.611">are probably those
who have not only tried,</text><text start="254.153" dur="2.49">but they have successfully
licked the elbow</text><text start="256.667" dur="1.691">of the person sitting next to them.</text><text start="258.382" dur="1.002">(Laughter)</text><text start="259.408" dur="1.685">Those are the extroverts.</text><text start="261.117" dur="3.419">Let me deal in a bit more detail
with extroversion,</text><text start="264.56" dur="2.959">because it&amp;#39;s consequential
and it&amp;#39;s intriguing,</text><text start="267.543" dur="3.481">and it helps us understand
what I call our three natures.</text><text start="271.048" dur="3.671">First, our biogenic nature --
our neurophysiology.</text><text start="274.743" dur="2.983">Second, our sociogenic or second nature,</text><text start="278.279" dur="3.858">which has to do with the cultural
and social aspects of our lives.</text><text start="282.744" dur="6.903">And third, what makes you
individually you -- idiosyncratic --</text><text start="290.19" dur="3.046">what I call your &amp;quot;idiogenic&amp;quot; nature.</text><text start="293.26" dur="1.156">Let me explain.</text><text start="296.901" dur="3.485">One of the things that characterizes
extroverts is they need stimulation.</text><text start="300.971" dur="4.724">And that stimulation can be achieved
by finding things that are exciting:</text><text start="305.719" dur="4.037">loud noises, parties
and social events here at TED --</text><text start="309.78" dur="3.227">you see the extroverts
forming a magnetic core.</text><text start="313.031" dur="1.659">They all gather together.</text><text start="314.714" dur="1.415">And I&amp;#39;ve seen you.</text><text start="316.153" dur="3.323">The introverts are more likely
to spend time in the quiet spaces</text><text start="319.5" dur="1.823">up on the second floor,</text><text start="321.347" dur="3.792">where they are able
to reduce stimulation --</text><text start="325.163" dur="3.935">and may be misconstrued
as being antisocial,</text><text start="329.122" dur="2.998">but you&amp;#39;re not necessarily antisocial.</text><text start="333.31" dur="2.898">It may be that you simply realize
that you do better</text><text start="337.436" dur="4.411">when you have a chance
to lower that level of stimulation.</text><text start="342.998" dur="4.148">Sometimes it&amp;#39;s an internal
stimulant, from your body.</text><text start="347.17" dur="4.915">Caffeine, for example, works much better
with extroverts than it does introverts.</text><text start="352.109" dur="3.179">When extroverts come into the office
at nine o&amp;#39;clock in the morning</text><text start="355.312" dur="2.885">and say, &amp;quot;I really need a cup of coffee,&amp;quot;</text><text start="358.221" dur="1.151">they&amp;#39;re not kidding --</text><text start="359.396" dur="1.173">they really do.</text><text start="361.531" dur="1.806">Introverts do not do as well,</text><text start="363.361" dur="2.517">particularly if the tasks
they&amp;#39;re engaged in --</text><text start="366.913" dur="1.545">and they&amp;#39;ve had some coffee --</text><text start="368.482" dur="2.138">if those tasks are speeded,</text><text start="370.644" dur="1.879">and if they&amp;#39;re quantitative,</text><text start="372.547" dur="4.394">introverts may give the appearance
of not being particularly quantitative.</text><text start="377.58" dur="1.64">But it&amp;#39;s a misconstrual.</text><text start="379.244" dur="3.044">So here are the consequences
that are really quite intriguing:</text><text start="382.312" dur="2.083">we&amp;#39;re not always what seem to be,</text><text start="384.419" dur="3.284">and that takes me to my next point.</text><text start="388.196" dur="2.556">I should say, before getting to this,</text><text start="390.776" dur="2.68">something about sexual intercourse,</text><text start="393.48" dur="2.101">although I may not have time.</text><text start="395.605" dur="2.872">And so, if you would like me to --</text><text start="398.501" dur="1.151">yes, you would?</text><text start="399.676" dur="1.151">OK.</text><text start="400.851" dur="1.085">(Laughter)</text><text start="401.96" dur="1.16">There are studies done</text><text start="403.144" dur="5.325">on the frequency with which
individuals engage in the conjugal act,</text><text start="409.406" dur="3.239">as broken down by male, female;
introvert, extrovert.</text><text start="413.1" dur="1.151">So I ask you:</text><text start="414.275" dur="2.072">How many times per minute --</text><text start="417.162" dur="1.884">oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry, that was a rat study --</text><text start="419.07" dur="2.007">(Laughter)</text><text start="422.151" dur="1.802">How many times per month</text><text start="426.715" dur="3.259">do introverted men engage in the act?</text><text start="430.486" dur="1.39">3.0.</text><text start="431.9" dur="1.632">Extroverted men?</text><text start="433.556" dur="1.61">More or less?</text><text start="435.616" dur="1.628">Yes, more.</text><text start="437.607" dur="2.367">5.5 -- almost twice as much.</text><text start="441.264" dur="2.568">Introverted women: 3.1.</text><text start="443.856" dur="1.596">Extroverted women?</text><text start="445.476" dur="3.346">Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,</text><text start="448.846" dur="1.737">which I will explain later --</text><text start="450.607" dur="1.581">they are heroic.</text><text start="452.973" dur="1.775">7.5.</text><text start="455.782" dur="2.352">They not only handle
all the male extroverts,</text><text start="458.158" dur="2.093">they pick up a few introverts as well.</text><text start="460.275" dur="1.896">(Laughter)</text><text start="462.195" dur="2.32">(Applause)</text><text start="468.796" dur="4.301">We communicate differently,
extroverts and introverts.</text><text start="474.576" dur="1.506">Extroverts, when they interact,</text><text start="476.106" dur="4.465">want to have lots of social encounter
punctuated by closeness.</text><text start="480.595" dur="2.991">They&amp;#39;d like to stand close
for comfortable communication.</text><text start="484.547" dur="2.199">They like to have a lot of eye contact,</text><text start="486.77" dur="1.344">or mutual gaze.</text><text start="489.241" dur="1.207">We found in some research</text><text start="490.472" dur="2.998">that they use more diminutive terms
when they meet somebody.</text><text start="493.873" dur="2.713">So when an extrovert meets a Charles,</text><text start="496.61" dur="2.885">it rapidly becomes &amp;quot;Charlie,&amp;quot;
and then &amp;quot;Chuck,&amp;quot;</text><text start="499.519" dur="1.679">and then &amp;quot;Chuckles Baby.&amp;quot;</text><text start="501.222" dur="1.492">(Laughter)</text><text start="503.032" dur="1.405">Whereas for introverts,</text><text start="504.461" dur="4.905">it remains &amp;quot;Charles,&amp;quot; until he&amp;#39;s given
a pass to be more intimate</text><text start="509.39" dur="2.22">by the person he&amp;#39;s talking to.</text><text start="512.044" dur="2.785">We speak differently.</text><text start="516.934" dur="5.237">Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
concrete, simple language.</text><text start="523.854" dur="3.794">Introverts prefer --
and I must again tell you</text><text start="527.672" dur="4.357">that I am as extreme an introvert
as you could possibly imagine --</text><text start="532.853" dur="1.717">we speak differently.</text><text start="534.594" dur="3.995">We prefer contextually complex,</text><text start="538.613" dur="1.932">contingent,</text><text start="540.569" dur="2.016">weasel-word sentences --</text><text start="542.609" dur="1.023">(Laughter)</text><text start="543.656" dur="1.362">More or less.</text><text start="545.385" dur="1.436">(Laughter)</text><text start="546.845" dur="1.2">As it were.</text><text start="548.069" dur="1.015">(Laughter)</text><text start="549.108" dur="2">Not to put too fine a point upon it --</text><text start="551.848" dur="1.173">like that.</text><text start="553.955" dur="1.402">When we talk,</text><text start="555.381" dur="1.742">we sometimes talk past each other.</text><text start="557.724" dur="2.628">I had a consulting contract
I shared with a colleague</text><text start="560.376" dur="3.004">who&amp;#39;s as different from me
as two people can possibly be.</text><text start="563.739" dur="1.779">First, his name is Tom.</text><text start="566.499" dur="1.214">Mine isn&amp;#39;t.</text><text start="567.737" dur="1.271">(Laughter)</text><text start="569.032" dur="1.931">Secondly, he&amp;#39;s six foot five.</text><text start="570.987" dur="1.952">I have a tendency not to be.</text><text start="572.963" dur="1.043">(Laughter)</text><text start="574.03" dur="3.723">And thirdly, he&amp;#39;s as extroverted
a person as you could find.</text><text start="577.777" dur="2.38">I am seriously introverted.</text><text start="580.67" dur="1.695">I overload so much,</text><text start="582.389" dur="4.814">I can&amp;#39;t even have a cup of coffee
after three in the afternoon</text><text start="587.227" dur="2.288">and expect to sleep in the evening.</text><text start="590.178" dur="3.952">We had seconded to this project
a fellow called Michael.</text><text start="595.32" dur="4.172">And Michael almost brought
the project to a crashing halt.</text><text start="600.528" dur="3.796">So the person who seconded him
asked Tom and me,</text><text start="605.244" dur="1.459">&amp;quot;What do you make of Michael?&amp;quot;</text><text start="606.727" dur="2.27">Well, I&amp;#39;ll tell you
what Tom said in a minute.</text><text start="609.021" dur="2.316">He spoke in classic &amp;quot;extrovert-ese.&amp;quot;</text><text start="611.955" dur="3.575">And here is how extroverted ears
heard what I said,</text><text start="615.554" dur="1.953">which is actually pretty accurate.</text><text start="617.531" dur="4.26">I said, &amp;quot;Well Michael does have
a tendency at times</text><text start="622.385" dur="3.286">of behaving in a way
that some of us might see</text><text start="626.489" dur="4.135">as perhaps more assertive
than is normally called for.&amp;quot;</text><text start="630.941" dur="2.31">(Laughter)</text><text start="633.611" dur="1.777">Tom rolled his eyes and he said,</text><text start="635.412" dur="2.529">&amp;quot;Brian, that&amp;#39;s what I said:</text><text start="638.629" dur="1.4">he&amp;#39;s an asshole!&amp;quot;</text><text start="640.053" dur="2.177">(Laughter)</text><text start="642.254" dur="1.821">(Applause)</text><text start="645.509" dur="1.267">Now, as an introvert,</text><text start="646.8" dur="5.181">I might gently allude to certain
&amp;quot;assholic&amp;quot; qualities</text><text start="652.005" dur="1.295">in this man&amp;#39;s behavior,</text><text start="653.324" dur="2.804">but I&amp;#39;m not going to lunge for the a-word.</text><text start="656.152" dur="1.776">(Laughter)</text><text start="659.228" dur="1.266">But the extrovert says,</text><text start="660.518" dur="2.874">&amp;quot;If he walks like one, if he talks
like one, I call him one.&amp;quot;</text><text start="663.416" dur="1.412">And we go past each other.</text><text start="665.498" dur="3.966">Now is this something
that we should be heedful of?</text><text start="669.488" dur="1.166">Of course.</text><text start="670.678" dur="1.584">It&amp;#39;s important that we know this.</text><text start="672.286" dur="1.539">Is that all we are?</text><text start="674.67" dur="2.041">Are we just a bunch of traits?</text><text start="677.563" dur="1.262">No, we&amp;#39;re not.</text><text start="680.116" dur="2.256">Remember, you&amp;#39;re like some other people</text><text start="683.266" dur="1.709">and like no other person.</text><text start="685.487" dur="2.435">How about that idiosyncratic you?</text><text start="688.485" dur="3.251">As Elizabeth or as George,</text><text start="691.76" dur="2.88">you may share your extroversion
or your neuroticism.</text><text start="696.251" dur="4.007">But are there some distinctively
Elizabethan features of your behavior,</text><text start="700.282" dur="2.197">or Georgian of yours,</text><text start="703.732" dur="3.85">that make us understand you
better than just a bunch of traits?</text><text start="708.24" dur="2.403">That make us love you?</text><text start="711.461" dur="2.994">Not just because you&amp;#39;re
a certain type of person.</text><text start="715.188" dur="2.624">I&amp;#39;m uncomfortable putting
people in pigeonholes.</text><text start="719.081" dur="2.591">I don&amp;#39;t even think pigeons
belong in pigeonholes.</text><text start="723.235" dur="2.069">So what is it that makes us different?</text><text start="726.004" dur="4.897">It&amp;#39;s the doings that we have
in our life -- the personal projects.</text><text start="731.403" dur="1.821">You have a personal project right now,</text><text start="733.248" dur="3.086">but nobody may know it here.</text><text start="737.504" dur="1.808">It relates to your kid --</text><text start="739.336" dur="2.2">you&amp;#39;ve been back three times
to the hospital,</text><text start="741.56" dur="1.896">and they still don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong.</text><text start="745.373" dur="1.324">Or it could be your mom.</text><text start="748.092" dur="2.102">And you&amp;#39;d been acting out of character.</text><text start="750.218" dur="1.562">These are free traits.</text><text start="753.521" dur="3.08">You&amp;#39;re very agreeable,
but you act disagreeably</text><text start="756.625" dur="3.873">in order to break down those barriers
of administrative torpor</text><text start="760.522" dur="1.151">in the hospital,</text><text start="761.697" dur="2.626">to get something
for your mom or your child.</text><text start="765.814" dur="1.507">What are these free traits?</text><text start="767.345" dur="2.57">They&amp;#39;re where we enact a script</text><text start="769.939" dur="2.653">in order to advance
a core project in our lives.</text><text start="773.744" dur="2.058">And they are what matters.</text><text start="775.826" dur="2.272">Don&amp;#39;t ask people what type you are;</text><text start="778.742" dur="2.754">ask them, &amp;quot;What are your core
projects in your life?&amp;quot;</text><text start="781.52" dur="1.784">And we enact those free traits.</text><text start="783.328" dur="1.315">I&amp;#39;m an introvert,</text><text start="784.667" dur="4.586">but I have a core project,
which is to profess.</text><text start="789.64" dur="1.208">I&amp;#39;m a professor.</text><text start="791.798" dur="1.857">And I adore my students,</text><text start="795.08" dur="1.587">and I adore my field.</text><text start="796.691" dur="5.778">And I can&amp;#39;t wait to tell them
about what&amp;#39;s new, what&amp;#39;s exciting,</text><text start="803.366" dur="2.252">what I can&amp;#39;t wait to tell them about.</text><text start="805.642" dur="1.82">And so I act in an extroverted way,</text><text start="807.486" dur="1.528">because at eight in the morning,</text><text start="809.038" dur="2.344">the students need a little bit of humor,</text><text start="811.406" dur="2.722">a little bit of engagement
to keep them going</text><text start="814.152" dur="1.451">in arduous days of study.</text><text start="816.277" dur="1.437">But we need to be very careful</text><text start="818.456" dur="2.956">when we act protractedly out of character.</text><text start="822.679" dur="4.732">Sometimes we may find
that we don&amp;#39;t take care of ourselves.</text><text start="829.309" dur="4.614">I find, for example, after a period
of pseudo-extroverted behavior,</text><text start="833.947" dur="2.3">I need to repair somewhere on my own.</text><text start="837.916" dur="3.119">As Susan Cain said in her &amp;quot;Quiet&amp;quot; book,</text><text start="841.059" dur="2.972">in a chapter that featured
the strange Canadian professor</text><text start="844.055" dur="1.995">who was teaching at the time at Harvard,</text><text start="847.145" dur="1.66">I sometimes go to the men&amp;#39;s room</text><text start="848.829" dur="3.696">to escape the slings and arrows
of outrageous extroverts.</text><text start="853.069" dur="1.084">(Laughter)</text><text start="854.177" dur="6.372">I remember one particular day
when I was retired to a cubicle,</text><text start="860.573" dur="1.925">trying to avoid overstimulation.</text><text start="863.117" dur="5.247">And a real extrovert came
in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,</text><text start="868.388" dur="1.955">but in the next cubicle over --</text><text start="870.367" dur="2.323">and I could hear various
evacuatory noises,</text><text start="872.714" dur="2.269">which we hate -- even our own,</text><text start="875.007" dur="2.73">that&amp;#39;s why we flush
during as well as after.</text><text start="877.761" dur="1.732">(Laughter)</text><text start="880.36" dur="4.59">And then I heard
this gravelly voice saying,</text><text start="884.974" dur="2.435">&amp;quot;Hey, is that Dr. Little?&amp;quot;</text><text start="887.433" dur="1.929">(Laughter)</text><text start="890.664" dur="6.367">If anything is guaranteed
to constipate an introvert for six months,</text><text start="897.055" dur="1.761">it&amp;#39;s talking on the john.</text><text start="898.84" dur="1.23">(Laughter)</text><text start="900.094" dur="2.1">That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m going now.</text><text start="902.696" dur="1.356">Don&amp;#39;t follow me.</text><text start="904.564" dur="1.179">Thank you.</text><text start="905.767" dur="9.118">(Applause)</text></transcript>
